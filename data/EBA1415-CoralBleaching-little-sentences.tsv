EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06110	O	4	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06110	O	5	That ocean covers about 1/3 of the surface of the entire globe and contains double the amount of water found in the Atlantic Ocean.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06110	O	6	The invertebrate animals live together in Colonies and tend to stay in one palce.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06110	R-7-50	7	The different type of algae living within the coral polyps give the corals their varying colors.
EBA1415_RHSG_2_CB_ES-05081	R-1-50	8	There are several things that cause coral bleaching (1) would be the shifting in trade winds.
EBA1415_RHSG_2_CB_ES-05081	O	9	The trade winds make sea water rise.
EBA1415_RHSG_2_CB_ES-05081	R-1-3	10	The trade winds also change water temperature

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-1-50	16	What lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching are many things such as shifting trade winds, photosynthesis, and zooxanthallae. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	17	Coral bleaching is when a coral loses its color.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	18	One cause is shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-1-2	19	Trade winds travel from east to west, causing warm waters to travel westward and the cold water to rise in the east.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	20	Tradewinds constantly shift, causing major changes in climat.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-1-3	21.1	Weaker trade winds cause higher water temperatures, which increases coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-3-50	21.2	Weaker trade winds cause higher water temperatures, which increases coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	22	In order for coral to survive, it needs photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	23	Algae lives in the coral tissues, called zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	24	Coral and zooxanthellae need each other to survive.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-4-5	25	Zooxanthellae gets energy fron the sun, combines it with CO2 and H2O to make oxygen and sugars.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-4-5	26	During this process, carbon is passed to the coral in forms of sugar.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-3-5	27	In order for coral to survive, it needs water temperature between 70-85 degrees F so photosynthesis can happen.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-3-4	28	When water temperature increases, the amount of CO2 decreases.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-3-14	29.1	When the water temperature is constantly changing due to tradewinds, that affects the balance the corals need to stay healthy. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-1-3	29.2	When the water temperature is constantly changing due to tradewinds, that affects the balance the corals need to stay healthy. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-14-50	30.1	Coral bleaching happens when the coral is unhealthy, the cause of this is due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-14-7	30.2	Coral bleaching happens when the coral is unhealthy, the cause of this is due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-1-3	31.1	Trade winds affect the balance of water temperature, which forces coral to eject the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-3-7	31.2	Trade winds affect the balance of water temperature, which forces coral to eject the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	32	Without the zooxanthellae, coral will not survive because it has no other way of geting the glucose it needs.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	O	33	Without the coral, the zooxanthellae will also die because the coral is its protection.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-7-14	34.1	When the zooxanthellae dies or is ejected, the coral becomes unhealthy and this is what leads to coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05390	R-14-50	34.2	When the zooxanthellae dies or is ejected, the coral becomes unhealthy and this is what leads to coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05049	O	35	The main thing that was mentioned alot was the levels of (CO2) and (H2O) also photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05049	R-4-50	36	The coral basically lives off of all those resource and when ever or how ever any of the (CO2) or (H2O) levels changed the coral would easily die.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05049	O	37	Also the shift and changing in the wind also effected the coral it shifted sometimes benefitting the coral but sometimes not based off how the wind movement was.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05049	R-13-50	38	The coral was also sensitive like if the water was to get salty that would hurt the coral

EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	40	Coral bleaching can happen depending in the enviorment.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	41	Coral bleaching is mostly found in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	42	People that noticed coral bleaching would keep record if it were mild, moderata, or servire.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	43	In 1998 coral bleaching was very wich was about the same time their were weaker trade winds.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	R-5-50	44	Coral need photoosynthesis because without it the coral will die.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	45	Coral bleaching happens when the coral does not have any air or oxygen.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	46	With out photosynthesis the coral could get cold and die.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	R-3-5	47	Coral need water temperatures between 70-85oF because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	R-7-50	48	Without zooxanthallae coral will die.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	49	And without coral zooxanthellae will die.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	R-7-50	50	During bleaching corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthallae algae.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	51	A massive coral bleaching event happened in 1998.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-05893	O	52	This event resulted in the death of 16% of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415post_TWNB_2_CB_ES-04972	O	53	The more coral bleaching the serious it gets.
EBA1415post_TWNB_2_CB_ES-04972	O	54	Less coral bleaching the less the serious.
EBA1415post_TWNB_2_CB_ES-04972	O	55	If less coral bleaching its not that big of a deal.//
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	R-6-50	56	The main cause of Coral Bleaching is because of stress.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	R-6-5	57	When corals have to much stress, it is hard to continue thier photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	O	58	They dont get enough nutrients there force they lose most if not all of thier color.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	O	59	Corals get stress from people who damage them, walking on them or dropping anchors on them but the biggest one is change in thier enviorment.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	O	60	They need it to be 70-80 degrees to be able to produce food without help of corals zooxanthellane cant survive and that affects them both.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	O	61	Coral Bleaching affects the coral and zooxanthellane's relationship.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	R-6-50	62.1	If the coral has to much stress it turns white because without nutrients all the zooxanthelane would die off.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	R-7-50	62.2	If the coral has to much stress it turns white because without nutrients all the zooxanthelane would die off.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05848	O	63	Coral Bleaching makes corals makes corals weak and more prone to disease and starvation.  //
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	64	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	65	Coral bleaching turns coral somewhat white.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	R-7-50	66	There are different things such as climate, zooxanthallae that effect the and rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	67	They are different due to locations and effects it has on the coral bleaching rate. /
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	68	The climate such as the temperatures has a tremendous effect on the rates.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	R-3-4	69.1	Changing the water temperature changes the amount of Carbon Dioxide.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	R-4-14	69.2	Changing the water temperature changes the amount of Carbon Dioxide.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	R-4-14	70	This effect threatens the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	71	Unhealthy coral can't bleach, decreasing the coral bleaching rate. /
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	72	Zooxanthallae usually benefits the coral but the effect changes when under bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	73	The zooxanthellae dies making the coral vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	74	This could decline the coral bleaching rate tremendously. /
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	75	Being that coral bleaching occurs underwater the location in the ocean is a big factor in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	76	The winds from trade winds in the Pacific Ocean travels from east to west.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	77	Upwelling in the eastern Pacific causes surface waters to be colder than in the western Pacific.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	78	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	79	Due to it containing more water than the other oceans.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	80	The location of coral bleaching increases the rate making the coastal regions most affected by coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	81	Coral bleaching is effected in many ways.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	82	They make it so the rate decreases or increases of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05341	O	83	The main two differences being the climate, locations, and zooxanthallae.  //
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06081	R-3-50	84	The difference betten the rates of coral bleaching is that as the temperature change so does the rate showing amounts of coral bleaching which is harmful ous as well as them 15 perecent of our coral reef have died due to coral bleaching in temperature change.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06081	O	85	Which I believe is sad because coral are living things too just like ous so we need to save their lives//
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-06067	R-13-50	86	The difference in rates of coral breeding is that corals are sensitive to ocean salinity (salty water)//
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-04932	O	87	Corals are getting bleached because of a phenomenon known to turn a white color and they die off.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-04932	O	88	1998 was the worst bleaching of them all with 77%.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-04932	O	89	The most faithful year was 1981 with only 1%.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-04932	R-7-50	90	The reason why the corals are bleached is because they don't have enough "zooxanthalle."
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-04932	O	91	Which makes corals have nutrients for photosynthesis.  //
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06223	O	92	Coral bleaching is the most noticeable thing in the ocean.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06223	R-3-50	93	Coral bleaching is when a coral turns all white.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06223	R-3-50	94	This can be caused by changing temperatures.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06223	O	95	Corals are also sensitve to ocean salinity.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06223	R-13-14	96	Then the ocean salinity decreases in shallow water it upsets the balance necessary for coral help.//
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06223	O	97	Out of time
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	98	The differences in the rates of coral bleaching is that theres no real determined rate of which the rates are going.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	99	It could be high rates of coral bleaching but that would lead to a problem of serious impact on the worlds coral reefs.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	100	Coral bleaching is most noticable in the pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	101	The pacific ocean covers about 1/3 of the surface of the entire globe.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	102	A coral polyp has a saclike body and a mouth surrounded by stinging tentacles.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	103	Coral reefs are only found in clear shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05816	O	104	Reasoning because of Algae, called zooxanthellae, live in the coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis. //
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04965	O	105	Coral bleaching is an event that takes place in a coral reef and when it separates it loses it color.
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04965	O	106	Another way of defining coral bleaching is, a phenomenon in which coral loses its color. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04965	R-4-50	107	Corals need the right amount of Carbon Dioxide, so that it won't lose its color and have energy. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04965	R-4-5B	108.1	If it has lower than normal carbon dioxide, corals will lose up yo 50% to 95% of its energy. Reef buildings corals need water temperatures between 70-85F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperatures. //
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04965	R-3-5	108.2	If it has lower than normal carbon dioxide, corals will lose up yo 50% to 95% of its energy. Reef buildings corals need water temperatures between 70-85F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperatures. //
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04716	O	109	The differences in the rates of Coral Bleaching are different all the time bevause certain things happen & many things change all the time.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04716	O	110	For example One Reason they change is because there is high water temperatures so it brings it down or up depending no How it changes.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04716	R-1-50	111	Also Another reason there is differences with coral Bleaching rates are because the trade wind strengths.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04716	R-1-50	112	They either are high ot low & this shifts the coral bleaching from mild, to moderate, to severe & this is why the are many differences in the rates of coral reefs.	//
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04867	R-1-50	113	The leads the the differences in the rates of coral bleaching are the shifts in trade winds in places such as the Pacific Ocean and the photosynthesis process of coral depending on how much carbon dioxide in the water. /
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04867	O	114	According to the document "Background: What is "Coral Bleaching?", "Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04867	O	115	This ocean covers 1/3 of the surface of the entire globe, and contains double the amount of water found in the Atlantic Ocean."
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04867	O	116	Because of how trade winds of the Pacific change every few years according to the document "Shifting Trade Winds" and how the process of photosynthesis for coral is very sensitive to change according to the document "Coral and Photosynthesis," it can mean that oceans and other bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean can be hazardous for coral. //
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	O	117	Coral is tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	O	118	A healthy coral is normaly the color coral.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	O	119	When people change the environment, it puts stress on corals.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	R-6-7	120.1	When the coral gets stressed they eject their algae, which  causes it to turn white.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	R-7-50	120.2	When the coral gets stressed they eject their algae, which  causes it to turn white.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	R-1-3	121.1	Also when the trade winds go down, and the water temperatures go up, it causes the coral to eject algae.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	R-3-7	121.2	Also when the trade winds go down, and the water temperatures go up, it causes the coral to eject algae.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	R-7-50	121.3	Also when the trade winds go down, and the water temperatures go up, it causes the coral to eject algae.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05070	R-7-50	122	Which makes the coral white.  //
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06065	O	123	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06065	O	124	One of the things that causes coral bleaching is blast fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06065	R-6-50	125	Another way coral bleaching occurs is by changes in their environment that put stress on the coral.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06065	R-6-7	126	This happens because increased stress on corals from the environment forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	127	The differences in the rates of coral bleaching is that first it started out not so major in 1980, but than it started increasing.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	128	The highest rate was in 1998 it reached up to more than 70 countries making a report of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	129	So on it started decreasing from there.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	130	Than again who knows how bad it is now 2014.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	131	The coral bleaching reports only went from 1980-2006.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	132	"Also did you know coral is often mistaken for a rock or even a plant.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	133	However, it is actually made upof tiny animals called polyps..."
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	134	I did not know that, and here I am thinking its a plant.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	135	They can only be found in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05168	O	136	This is partly because alagae, called zooxantheallae, live in the coral tissues. Ran out of time//
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	137	Enviormental change causes coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	138	Enviormental stressors throws off the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	139	These two organism have a symbiotic relationship where both benefit (mutualism).
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	140	The coral helps the zoox by giving it a good enviorment to allow photosynthesis.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	141	the zoox gives the coral it's energy to survive and it's color.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	R-6-7	142	Stress from the enviorment on corals causes it to eject it's algae (zooxanthallae).
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	R-7-50	143	When corals eject from algae it turns white, this makes corals open to starvation and diseases due to the lost of zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	144	Coral bleaching happens mostly in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	145	The winds of the Pacific trade travel east to west the wind drags warm water westward.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	146	While the deeper, cooler water in the eastern part of the Pacific rises to the surface.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05330	O	147	This is known as upwelling.

EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06186	O	155	However it is really made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06186	O	156	A coral polyps has a saclike body and a mouth surroudned by stingign tentacles.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06186	O	157	Coral polyps range in size form tiny (the size of a pinhead up to a foot in diameter.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06186	O	158	Coral and zooxanthellae algae havea a symbiotic relationship.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06186	O	159	This mean that they both benefit from their relationship with each other.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06186	O	160	The algae rely on the coral to stay healthy but coral can sustain physical damage from some destructive practices.

EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	162	There are many things that lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	163	One of them is how things change and threatens the corals health.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	R-3-4	164	For example; in the article coral & photosynthesis it says, "As water temperature increases, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in water decreases.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	R-4-14	165	Changes in the amount of Co2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy."
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	166	Meaning that they need a specific amount, and if it changes, the corals won't be healthy.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	167	What is coral bleaching?
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	168	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	169	(Background: What is Coral Bleaching?)
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	170	Coral bleaching can lead to serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	171	The # of countries reporting coral coral bleaching every year goes up down, up down, up down throughout the years.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	172	Not until 1998 were about 73 or 74 countries reported coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	173	On the article coral and zooxanthallae it says, "For example, a massive coral bleaching event in 1998 is considered one of the worst ever observed.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	174	This event resulted in the death of 16% of the worlds coral reefs."
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	175	Meaning that all of the years before they had trouble but not as bad as the one in that year./
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05159	O	176	In conclusion, there are many things that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching most of it is the environmental change, which can cause stress to corals.//
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	177	Coral bleaching is a process of dependence.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-7-5B	178	The corals need an algae called zooxanthallae that lives inside of them to be there.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-7-5B	179	They give the coral the food that they make from the sun's energy, and the zooxanthallae is also the reason for their colorful substance.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	180	The zooxanthallae isnt just in the coral for the heck of it, either.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	181	The zooxanthallae is there because there are not enough nutrients for it to survive.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	182	They need eachother to produce a life.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	183	Usually, the coral and zooxanthallae lives in shallow waters so its easy to gain the nutrients they both need through photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-4-5B	184	The zooxanthallae passes carbon dioxide to the coral, giving it sugar.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-7-50	185	Now, if the water level changes, the zooxanthallae dies.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-7-50	186	This is what happened and is happening that is the reason why so much coral bleaching is happening.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-3-50	187.1	In 1998, when there were higher water temperatures and weaker trade winds, a massive frenzy of coral bleaching occured.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-1-50	187.2	In 1998, when there were higher water temperatures and weaker trade winds, a massive frenzy of coral bleaching occured.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	188	This is because the water level rose, making the zooxanthallae too far down in the water.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	O	189	The sunlight wouldn't get it, so it wouldn't produce the sugars for itself or the corals.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-7-14	190.1	When the zooxanthallaw died, or left to a place with what it needed, the coral lost its life source.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-14-50	190.2	When the zooxanthallaw died, or left to a place with what it needed, the coral lost its life source.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04805	R-14-50	191	This is causing the corals colors to go away. //
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	192	There are many different ways that coral bleaching can happen.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	193	Coral bleaching is when the coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	194	Coral is made up of little animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	195	Polyps use limestone from the water to build a hard skeleton around it's self.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	R-14-50	196	When corals become unhealthy they start to lose their color. /
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	R-1-50	197	To begin, trade winds can create coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	198	Every few years trade winds weaken.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	R-1-2	199	"The trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow from west to east.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	R-1-2	200	Under these circumstances, warm surface waters are dragged eastward  towards south America." (Shifting trade winds)
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	201	This quote shows that when this happens it causes the central and eastern pacific to swell, and the sea levels rise from inches to as much as a foot which can increase the temperature.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	R-3-50	202.1	In trade winds and coral bleaching, it shows that when there are weaker trade winds and high water temperature the coral bleaching reports go up. /
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	R-1-50	202.2	In trade winds and coral bleaching, it shows that when there are weaker trade winds and high water temperature the coral bleaching reports go up. /
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	203	Coral bleaching can also happen when there are changes in their environment.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06037	O	204	In the article "coral and zooxanthallae" the text says, "However, the most dangerous to the health of corals are those that are caused by changes in their environment that put stress on coral." //
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-06171	R-7-50	205	Different leads in Rates of coral bleaching are zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-06171	O	206	Coral polyp has a saclike body and a mouth surrounded by stinging tentacles.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-06171	O	207	Coral reefs are only found in clear shallow, Tropical waters.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-06171	O	208	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-06171	O	209	The result of bleaching event that makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-06171	O	210	While some dying reefs recover from such events, many do not- so to me this means//
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04902	R-3-50	211.1	The difference of the rates of coral bleaching is the water temperature and the trade wind strength.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04902	R-1-50	211.2	The difference of the rates of coral bleaching is the water temperature and the trade wind strength.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04902	O	212	These can have a big effect on coral.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04902	R-3-4	213.1	The reason for that is when water temperature changes the Carbon Dioxide in the water decreases.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04902	R-4-50	213.2	The reason for that is when water temperature changes the Carbon Dioxide in the water decreases.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04902	R-4-50	214	So if this happen it can be unhealthy to the coral than bleaching can occur so that's why sometimes the bleaching rate is up maybe of the water temperature.  //
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	O	215	The corals that are most affected by coral bleaching are located in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	R-1-50	216	Since the trade winds blow there as well, it has led me to believe that the trade winds as well as humans, affect the differences in coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	O	217	The differences in coral bleaching change because, partly, by humans.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	O	218	When we drop anchors in the sea it could potentially land on a coral and it would kill it.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	O	219	This could explain why there is a small amount of coral bleachings from 1988 to 1997.  /
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	R-1-50	220	Another thing that differs the differences in coral bleaching is the trade winds themselves.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	R-1-3	221	It is stated in one of the articles that the trade winds switch direction every few years.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	R-1-3	222.1	This causes the temperature to rise, making the carbon dioxide in water decrease.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	R-3-4	222.2	This causes the temperature to rise, making the carbon dioxide in water decrease.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	O	223	This then carbon dioxide in water decrease.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	O	224	This then leads to the coral's health.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04872	R-4-14	225	When the amount of CO2 changes the health of the coral is put in danger. //
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06142	O	226	Biologists have discovered many different types of corals.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06142	O	227	Coral bleaching is a serious problem with a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.

EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06142	R-3-5	229	Corals need water between 75o-80of because their photosynthesis process is sensitive.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06142	O	230	Corals provide protected nutrients for Algae.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06142	O	231	Algae relies on the coral to stay healthy, but corals can substain physical damage from destructive practices.//
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05899	O	232	Something that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is that environment changes are the main factor of why coral bleaching occures.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05899	R-6-7	233	In the text "Coral and Zooxanthallae," it says that environment changes put stress on coral, and if coral stresses, it's forced to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05899	O	234	It gets bleached b/c they become susceptible to disease & starvation, whcih most can't recover from it, then they die.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05899	O	235	Algae relies on coral to stay healthy, and coral relies on algae, so if the algae isn't healthy coral looses its strength and can die, same goes for the algae.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05899	R-11-12	236.1	The changes on the coral can also be due to the weather of extreme storms b/c corals are sensitive to the ocean salinity, this is b/c it adds fresh water in the ocean and the salinity decreases, then this upsets the balance necessary for coral health.

EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05740	R-3-1	240.2	What mainly leads to different rates of coral bleaching is trade winds, when the water temperature is high the trade wind is low.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05740	R-1-3	241	When the trade wind is low the temperature is high.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05740	R-1-50	242	The coral bleaching come from when the trade winds are low.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05740	O	243	In the text it says, "need - water tempertures between 70-85 degrees."
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05740	O	244	So that means the winds are low the temperature is high.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-11-50	246	One effect that leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is natural causes such as extreme storms.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-11-12	247.1	These storms increase the amount of fresh water and decrease the salinity of the water.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-12-13	247.2	These storms increase the amount of fresh water and decrease the salinity of the water.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	O	248	Coral reefs need a balanced amount of salt and seawater in order to ? to develope its hard skeleton.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	O	249	Another example is ocean temperature.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-3-4	250.1	When the temperature of the water increases the amount of Co2 the reefs recieve decreases which affects the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-4-5	250.2	When the temperature of the water increases the amount of Co2 the reefs recieve decreases which affects the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	O	251	Photosynthesis gives the zooxanthellae energy from the sun and combine the sunlight with Co2 in the ocean with H2O.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	O	252	This causes bleaching and O2 to far.... Algae then provides carbon to the coral as energy.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-5-7	253.1	If coral reefs do not undergo photosynthesis the algae will be ejected and this will lead to coral reefs loosing their color.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-7-50	253.2	If coral reefs do not undergo photosynthesis the algae will be ejected and this will lead to coral reefs loosing their color.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	R-5-5B	254	So since coral reefs receive 50% to 95% of their energy from photosynthesis it's important to their survival.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05403	O	255	Another reason as to why coral reefs undergo bleaching is due to anthropogenic processes such as overfishing/blast fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on the reefs and discount their process of photosynthesis.//
EBA1415_HNJD_4_ES_CB-05805	O	256	According to "Coral and zooxanthallae," coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_ES_CB-05805	R-4-5	257	According to "Coral and Photosynthesis," During the photosynthesis zooxanthellae use energy from sunlight to combine Carbon Dioxide in the ocean with water.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_ES_CB-05805	O	258	This combination results in the formation of sugars and oxygen.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_ES_CB-05805	O	259	As this is occuring carbon is passed from the algae to the coral in the form of glucose.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_ES_CB-05805	R-4-5	260	As long as theres enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.

EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05065	O	362	So basically the sources I just read about Coral and Zooxanthallae is that they are only in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05065	O	363	But my question is do they occur or appear to be anywhere else.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05065	O	364	Also I didn't see how does the coral actually turn white or why does it turn white.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05065	O	365	My question is how come it cant be a different color.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05065	R-11-13	366	I didnt know a storm can mess up the formation of the build of coral and that Salinity can decrease in shallow coastal regions during storms.

EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04961	O	383	Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical water. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04961	O	384	This is partly because algae, called zooxantellae, live in the coral tissue and need light for the process of photosynthesis. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04961	R-4-5	385	During photosynthesis, zooxanthellae use energy from sunlight to combine carbon dioxide in the ocean with water.
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04961	O	386	This combination results in the formation of sugars and oxygen. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04961	O	387	As this occuring, carbon is passed from the algae to the coral in the form of glucose (sugar). 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04961	R-4-5	388	As long as there is enough sunlight and normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.

EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	391	In introduction, I believe the different rates of coral bleaching are caused by various reasons.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	392	From observations, I see that from 1980-2006, the coral bleaching have been severe and I think I know why.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	393	In the text, it states that "coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical water."
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	394	It also states that "coral are sensitive to ocean salinity (how salty the water is)."
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	395	Overall I believe that's what caused the coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	396	Every few years, trade winds are altered; and the trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow from west to east.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	397	The water may be salty and coral reefs need fresh water (clean) because algae, called zooxanthellae, live in the coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis. /
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	398	Secondly, the movement of warm water eastward causes major shifts in the world's climate, this impact is especially true along equatorial regions.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	R-2-3	399	Normal water temperature in these regions is 70-80 degrees F, however when surface water shifts eastward, ocean water increases by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F, sometimes 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	R-1-50	400	Basically, what I'm trying to say is that when Pacific trade winds decrease, coral bleaching increases.
EBA1415_TTKP_78_CB_ES-04916	O	401	Honestly, one thing leads to another.

EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04678	O	595	Coral bleaching is an example of how environment effects the coral.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04678	R-7-50	596	Corals turn white due to death of the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04678	O	597	During bleaching, coral turns vulnerable and is the very easy to obtain diseases and starvation.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04678	O	598	A massive coral bleaching happened in 1998.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04678	O	599	It resulted in the death of 16% of the world's coral reefs.//
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	R-7-50	600	Coral bleaching is when coral turns white due to the ejection or death of zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	601	There are many causes to this problem. /
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	602	First, differences in the rates of coral bleaching happen because coral is sensative to environmental changes.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	603	For example, corals take stress from their environment.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	604	If the water has more or less salt then it should or the water is cooler or hotter than it should be, then the coral is stressed and releases the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	605	When the zooxanthellae algae is released, the coral turns white which is coral bleaching, and is vulnerable to disease or starvation because of the loss of the zooxanthellae algae. /
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	606	Also, differences in the rates of coral bleaching happen because of the physical damage the coral takes.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	607	Coral can only take so much damage until it releases the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	608	Examples include, when humans are involved, like blast fishing or when humans drop anchors or walk on the coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	R-7-50	609	Too much of this results in the coral to release the zooxanthellae algae and cause bleaching. /
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04760	O	610	All of this proves that how there are differeces in the rates of coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	611	Most Coral's bleaching is in the biggest ocean.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	R-4-50	612	The Pacific Ocean, where coral bleach it is because it doesn't have enough CO2.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	R-3-5	613	Corals neeed temperaures between 70-85 degree F because the process of photosynthesis is really sensitive to the changes in the water, temperature.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	614	Corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	615	Corals are made up of little tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	616	Coral polyps range from pinhead tiny to a foot in diameter.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	617	It is rare that corals survive when they bleach.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	618	In 1998 coral bleaching was considered the most tragic bleaching observed.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04845	O	619	16% of corals died from bleaching around the world's coral reefs.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	621	The differences in the rates of coral bleaching occur because of many reasons.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	622	Some of those reasons are changes in the environment and climate change. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	623	Change in the environment heavly affects the difference in coral because coral is very dependent and vulnerable.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	624	Coral depends on salinity, CO2 levels, temperature, and zooxanthellae (algae).
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	R-11-13	625.1	A corals salinity balance can be easily threatened by extreme storms, tropical storms, hurricanes, and other produces of excessive rainfall because of the increase of freshwater distroying the balance of saltwater.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	R-11-12	625.2	A corals salinity balance can be easily threatened by extreme storms, tropical storms, hurricanes, and other produces of excessive rainfall because of the increase of freshwater distroying the balance of saltwater.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	R-12-13	625.3	A corals salinity balance can be easily threatened by extreme storms, tropical storms, hurricanes, and other produces of excessive rainfall because of the increase of freshwater distroying the balance of saltwater.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	626	Coral also depend on the CO2 levels.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	R-4-50	627	CO2 is necessary for algae to undergo photosynthesis, but if the CO2 levels are too low, then it will become a problem for coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	628	CO2 levels are determined by the temperature of the water (70-85 degree F).
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	R-1-50	629.1	That's why trade winds are another huge threat towards coral because when surface waters shift to the east, the ocean's water temperature incease 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F, and 10 degree F in some places.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	R-3-4	630	The increase in temperature will decrease the CO2 level, harming the algae and corals. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04750	O	631	Changes in the environment and climate change are the biggest reasons on what leads to the differeces in the rates of coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	R-1-50	632	One of the main leads to Coral bleching is the environmental change would be the trade winds.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	O	633	During trade winds the sea level may rise anywhere from inches to a foot.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	R-4-5	634	According to the document, during photosynthesis zooxanthellae use energy from sunlight to mix Carbon Dioxide in the ocean with water.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	O	635	As stated in the passage the chemicals that the algae (zooxanthellae) makes provides the coral with the energy it reads to survive.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	O	636	Due to the sea level shifting however, the amount of sunlight the coral would need would then be being altered (If you will).
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	R-1-50	637.1	In 1997-1998 when the trade wind was just passed -8000 the coral bleaching reports was at it's highest which would lead one to the statement "As water temperature increase the amount of Carbon duvide in wate decreases.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	R-3-4	637.2	In 1997-1998 when the trade wind was just passed -8000 the coral bleaching reports was at it's highest which would lead one to the statement "As water temperature increase the amount of Carbon duvide in wate decreases.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-05973	R-4-14	638	Changes in the amount of Co2 threaten the delicate balance necessary for Coral health, and of course pollution and things of that nature play a role in coral bleaching also.//
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	639	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which the coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	640	Coral bleaching is a serious problem with a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	641	Coral bleaching is more noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	642	The algae rely on the coral to stay healthy but corals can sustain physical damage from some destructive practices.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	643	Some examples are blast fishing and toursits who drop anchors or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	644	The most dangerous threats to the health of corals are those that are caused by changes in their environment that put stress on coral.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05699	O	645	Coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae. //
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-1-50	646.1	There are many factors that can cause coral bleaching.

EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-6-50	646.3	There are many factors that can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-1-50	647.1	Some happen naturally like shifting trade winds and photosynthesis, but others are caused by humans and the stress we unknowingly inflict on them. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-5-50	647.2	Some happen naturally like shifting trade winds and photosynthesis, but others are caused by humans and the stress we unknowingly inflict on them. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-6-50	647.3	Some happen naturally like shifting trade winds and photosynthesis, but others are caused by humans and the stress we unknowingly inflict on them. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-1-50	648	One reason why coral bleaching  occurs is the shift in trade winds.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	649	Although trade winds were originally used for boat navigation, they have an important purpose for the earth's oceans.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-1-2	650	In a phenomenon known as upwelling, the winds drag warm surface waters to the west and the cold, deep waters in the eastern Pacific rise to the top.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-1-2	651	But every few years, the trade winds are altered and the warm waters are dragged to the east.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	652	This causes the central and eastern Pacific regions to swell which in turn leads to major shifts in the world's climate.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-2-3	653	The normal water temperature in these regions is between 70-85 degrees F, but when the waters shift eastward, temperatures can even increase over 10 degress F. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-5-50	654	Another cause for coral bleaching is photosynthesis.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-4-5	655	Coral reefs are only found in tropical waters because the algae, called zooxanthellae, that lives in the tissues of the coral need sunlight for photosythesis.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-4-5	656	During this process, the algae uses the energy from the sun to combine CO2 with H2O, resulting in sugars and oxygen.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	657	As this happens, carbon is passed from the algae to the coral in the form of glucose.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-3-4	658	This process is very sensitive to water temperature and if the temperature goes up, then the amount of CO2 in the water decreases.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-4-14	659	If the amount of CO2  is not normal, it threatens the delicate balance needed to keep corals healthy. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	660	A final reason is the stress out on coral, not just by their environment, but by humans as well.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	661	Things like blast fishing, toursits dropping anchors, and people walking on reefs can cause physical damge to the coral.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-6-7	662	This, combined with environment changes, causes increased stres levels on corals and forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	R-7-50	663	The death and ejection of this algae turns the coral white and leaves it vulnerable to disease and starvation. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	664	To finalize, there are many factors that threaten the coral in our world.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	665	Although some can't be stopped or controlled, like shifting trade winds and photosynthesis, others can be prevented.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	666	For example, fishing away from coral reefs and warning tourists to not step on them.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05205	O	667	I think if people realize thet are hurtung the coral reefs we can all work together to stop the increase of bleached coral.  //
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-05033	O	668	There are many different waves that can lead to a coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-05033	O	669	One way could be because of physical damage done on the coral.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-05033	O	670	When damage is done to the coral, the algae, which helps the coral get food and provides the coral with color, is ejected from the coral.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-05033	O	671	The reasons that the coral can recieve such damage is because of blast fishing or tourism.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-05033	R-7-50	672	So without algae the coral turns white and is vulnerable to diseases and starvation.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-05033	O	673	This causes most coral reefs to die.//

EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	O	683	Coral needs a certain temperature of water because it is very sensitive.

EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	O	685	Coral reefs are found in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	O	686	This is because the algae that lives on the coral must undergo the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	R-4-50	687	If they aren't around the right amounts of Co2 then that could be a big problem for the algae and the coral.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	O	688	They are kind of like a team and they depend on each other to keep living.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	R-5-5B	689.1	If the algae doesn't go through photosynthesis and it doesn't give the coral the food it needs, then they both die.

EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	R-7-50	693.1	This happens because the stress put on coral causes the coral to eject, or get rid of, their food producing algae.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	R-6-7	693.2	This happens because the stress put on coral causes the coral to eject, or get rid of, their food producing algae.

EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	O	695	Coral bleaching can occur on great reefs in the ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05189	O	696	If coral dies, then it can start a chain reaction of other things in the sea dying as well.

EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06249	R-6-50	922	Coral bleaching is cause by changes in their environment that put stress on coral.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06249	R-6-7	923	This is because increased stress on coral from the environment forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06249	R-7-50	924	During bleaching, corals turn white due to ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae. //
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	925	One way that corals are bleached is by damage.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	926	People who go fishing often use anchors that land on other corals and damage them.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	927	They are not able to recover from it and just die.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	928	Another way is how the trade winds change.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	929	When the winds go to the east they bring warmer waters.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	930	The corals need to stay in between of 70-85 degrees F.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	R-3-50	932	When it go up they can also die.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	R-3-4	933	When the carbon dioxide starts to decrease then the CO2 will need to change to keep it alive.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	R-3-4	934	This happens because of the change in water.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	R-3-50	935	When the temperatures go up they will start to die due to this.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	R-11-12	936	Another way is when it rains a lot in the ocean it brings fresh water.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05605	O	937	The coral needs to stay in salt water with this the fresh water mixs with the salt and can potientaly kill many weak corals.

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	O	952	There are few possbilities of what leads to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	O	953	One possibility is the temperature change in the water.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-3-5	954	In the document Coral & Photosynthesis, it states "Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature" This shows that corals need a specific temperature or there is a huge chance they won't survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-1-3	955	In 1998, the trade winds were at a really weak point leading to high water temperatures.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	O	956	Over to countries reported coral bleaching because of that.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-1-50	957	If the trade winds don't stay at a consistant strength then we will most likely always have problem with coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-13-50	958.1	Another possibility for the cause of coral bleaching could be salinity levels in the ocean after a lot of rainfall.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-11-13	958.2	Another possibility for the cause of coral bleaching could be salinity levels in the ocean after a lot of rainfall.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-11-13	959.1	Corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity and a decrease due to rainfall may upset the salinity balance necessary for coral to survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-11-14	959.2	Corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity and a decrease due to rainfall may upset the salinity balance necessary for coral to survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	O	960	A final possibility of how coral bleaching is caused is the amount of sunlight the coral is given.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	O	961	The algae might not undergo photosynthesis if there is not enough sunlight.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	R-5-5B	962	If the algae is performing photosynthesis then the coral won't be provided the energy they need to survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05170	O	963	Overall, temperature, salinity, and sunlight are all possibilities of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	964	Coral bleaching, an easy thing to happen but hard to fix coral bleaching is when different types aren't able to give coral the things they need to stay healthy and keep there color so they turn a plain white.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	965	So how does this bleaching process take place?
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	966	Many things add onto the process of this phenomenon.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	967	This process beings by the trade winds from the central and eastern Pacific regions to swell.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	968	Consequent sea levels rise anywhere from inches to as well as a foot.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	969	The mixture of these waters causes the temperature to change anywhere from 3F increasing to 5F or even over 10F.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	R-3-5	970	The main level of temperature that is needed for the process of photosynthesis to happen and to feed the alge such as zooxanthelle is from 70-80F.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05429	O	971	Dramatic changes in temperature can effect a lot, as in 1998, 16% of the world's reefs were killed in over about 73 countries.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	O	1055	There is a few explanations of what leads to different rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	O	1056	One reason is because the wind oushes the water.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-1-50	1057	My evidence is "The Trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow from west to east." pg3
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-1-50	1058	This shows that the water is moving to different locations & its making more coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-11-12	1059	My second reason is that the storm gets more fresh water & pushes the water when theres big waves.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-11-13	1060	My second evidence is "salinity can decrease in shallow coastal regions during storms that cause excessive rainfall, like hurricanes ot tropical storms.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-11-12	1061.1	These storns increase the amount of fresh water in the Ocean, which causes the salinity to drop."
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-12-13	1061.2	These storns increase the amount of fresh water in the Ocean, which causes the salinity to drop."
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-13-14	1062.1	This makes the rates higher or different because it the salinity drops, it upsets the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05394	R-14-50	1062.2	This makes the rates higher or different because it the salinity drops, it upsets the balance necessary for coral health.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04737	O	1191	Now, we have found another use for trade winds; upwelling.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04737	O	1192	This is where the deeper, colder waters in the Eastern Pacific rise to the surace.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04737	O	1193	They usually blow east to west.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04737	O	1210	This then makes the coral vulnerable to disease & starvation.  //
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05165	R-3-50	1211	What leads to different rates of coral bleaching is the water temperature affects the coral is because of how sensitive the algae is.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05165	O	1212	The algae needs to go through the process of photosynthesis so in order for that to work, they need to live in shallow, clear tropical waters.

EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04828	R-3-50	1227	This shows that when the waters warm, the coral will grow more.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04828	O	1228	If the water is cold, then the coral will not grow properly. /
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04828	O	1229	Also, photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to help algae keep coral healthy.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04828	O	1230	In the document "Coral and Photosynthesis," it talks about how coral gets the sun's energy, "During photosynthesis, Zooxanthellae use energy from the sunlight."
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04828	O	1231	This shows that coral also needs lots of sunshine to be healthy. /

EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04806	O	1336	Trade winds were origanally used to guide boats.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04806	O	1337	There is upwelling in the Eastern Pacific which is causing the surface water to be colder than the western Pacific.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04806	R-3-50	1338	When surface waters shift the ocean water increases by 3 degree F to 5 degree F, sometimes 10 degree F.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04806	R-3-50	1339	This is another reason why coral bleaching is happening.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	O	1348	What causes coral bleaching is the topic that we will be addressing today.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	R-1-14	1349	To start of the trade winds constantly shifting cause constant climate change which is unhealthy for coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	R-1-2	1350	When the winds shift they move warm water westward which cause water pools, they cause colder water to rise up to coral reefs which are suppose to be in warm water.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	R-3-5	1351	Further more water temperature must be between 70-85 degrees F for photosynthesis to occur which is vital to a coral reef's life.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	O	1352	That's why lots of sunlight and CO2 is needed.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	R-11-3	1353.1	Storms affect not only temperature but salinity in water.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-6288	R-11-13	1353.2	Storms affect not only temperature but salinity in water.

EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	O	1356	Coral bleaching is caused or the rates of coral bleaching is increasing and changing because many physical damages are happening to the corals and this effects their health.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	O	1357	For example, fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on the reefs threatens the envionment of corals and these action changes the corals envionment so it causes stress for the corals.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	R-6-7	1358.1	When the corals are stress, they eject their food-producing algae and this increases them to change colors and die.

EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	O	1359	Another thing that happens coral health is salinity.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	R-13-50	1360.1	If there isn't enough salinity need for coral health, they will die and change into white color.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	R-50-50	1360.2	If there isn't enough salinity need for coral health, they will die and change into white color.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05691	R-11-12	1361.1	For example, when there is hurricane or tropical storms, it increases the amount of fresh water in the ocean and this causes salinity to drop.

EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05651	O	1363	Coral bleaching has many different rates of happening.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05651	R-1-2	1364	For example in the shifting trade winds it explains that when it weakens the warm water is blow from west to east causing the regions to swell making the qualitu of the water and not enough for the coral to survive.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05651	R-4-5B	1365	Th reason is that the amount of carbon dioxide in water decreases making the algae not able to produce food for itself and coral.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05651	O	1366	Another example of a rate is the changes in the coral's environment like polution.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05651	O	1367	This a dangerous threat to the health of the coral and making if vulnerable to disease and starvation. //
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	O	1368	If these documents, I believe they are all supposed to be several different reasons behind coral bleaching, but honestly, I see them all intertwined with each otehr.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	R-1-50	1369	My theory is that it starts with the trade winds, when comparing the two maps provided, I noticed that the most coral bleaching occurs in warmer winds near the equator, in other words, it's hot!
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	R-1-50	1370	The tabels show that when trade winds slow, the amount of coral bleaching increases dramatically.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	R-1-50	1371.1	I hypothesize that the coral bleaching occures when the trade winds slow is because the coral water must be at a certain temprature, so when winds slow, the hot sun heats up the water and bleaches teh coral./

EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	R-3-4	1372.1	Here is my theory as to how these connect, and why they need warmer temperatures; as temperatures rise, there is less Co2 in the water, and coral needs Co2 to survive, which explaisn why is bleachees when the temperatures rise./

EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	O	1373	Now here's where my theory gets a bit unsure; it is possible that zooxanthelle and the algae which helps teh coral survive, require co2.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	O	1374	If this were the case (maybe it is), it would confirm my theory.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05323	R-3-4	1375.1	if the algae does require Co2, then when tempratures rise, they leave the coral to try to find Co2, then the coral bleaches.//

EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04915	O	1383	Trade winds were used to guide boats but now have a much more important purpose, when deeper colder water in the pacific rises to the surface.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04915	O	1384	This is known as upwelling.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04915	R-3-50	1385	In the western Pacific, the sea levels rise from inches to a foot when a trade wind shifts, The higher the water temp the more likely coral bleaches.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04915	O	1386	Coral often mistaken as a rock is actually a bunch of small animals called polyps.

EBA1415_HNJD_4_CB_ES-05810	O	1441	The algae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but corals can sustain physical damage from some destructive practices.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_CB_ES-05810	O	1442	This is because people blast fishing, tourists who walk on the reef or drop anchors on the reef.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_CB_ES-05810	O	1443	Most damgerous threat to the coral is changes in the environment.

EBA1415_HNJD_4_CB_ES-05810	R-7-50	1449	Due to the ejection or death of the Zooxanthellae algae. //
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1450	Coral bleaching, is a scientific explanation in which the coral loses its color.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1451	This impacts the world's coral reefs in many ways.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1452	Such as the world's climate, an algae called zooxanthellae and changes in their environment./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1453	The world's climate explains the leads of differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1454	For example, the Pacific trade winds effect much of the pacific ocean regions. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	R-1-2	1455	There is this movement that causes the wind to drag warm surface waters westward. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1456	This leading towards sea levels rising. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1457	Causing a type of swelling and endangering most of the coral residing in that area.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1458	Coral is only functional be with the help of a symbiotic algae, but if the climate isn't doing them any justice then, that's the end of the beautiful/colorful corals./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1459	Another difference in the rates of coral bleaching has to do with an algae called zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1460	Coral is made up of a bunch of tiny animals.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1461	These animals are called polyps.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1462	Polyps build a hard skeleton that later transform into coral reefs.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1463	Now zooxanthellae live in the coral tissues because the sunlight is more clear, and can help them perform photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1464	As long as their is sunlight available the algae will do photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1465	This is important because the chemicals provided by the algae help keep the coral reef alive.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1466	But there are some dangers to this process, the temperature of the water is the main factor of how that changes the coral reefs environment.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	R-7-50	1467	Without the algae the look white or bleached./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1468	Coral reefs need a balanced temperature of 70-85 because the manufacturement of photosynthesis is delicate to the water temp.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1469	Basically, meaning that photosynthesis is indeed a big deal for coral reefs and can be compromised, of a slight weather change.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	R-11-50	1470	Also, speaking of weather, big storms are also threatening to coral reefs.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1471	Coral reefs need the salinity in the water; but when it rains or tropical storms occur the balance is dangerous./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1472	Coral bleaching impacts all the coral reefs in the world.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04876	O	1473	Meaning that because of the weather and climate changes, most of the reef in our mystical ocean can be destroyed.//
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1474	Coral bleaching can be happening in many ways.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1475	But coral bleaching is when coral loses its natural color.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1476	It can have a serious impact on the coral reefs.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1477	Corals are animals.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1478	They can be found in clear shallow tropical waters.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1479	Corals provide a protected nutrient-rich enviornment for the algae.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1480	They make food from the sun, But algae relys on coral to stay naturally healthy.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1481	1998 has had the most severe coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1482	Coral is not a rock nor plant it is made up of tiny animals called polyp.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-05068	O	1483	It's mouth is surrounded with stinging tentacles and also have a hard skeleton from the limestone in the sea over time they build up and create coral reefs.//
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	O	1484	A major problem in the ocean is coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	O	1485	Coral bleaching is when coral looses it's color turns white.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	O	1486	One way that coral bleaching happens is when an organism called zooxanthelle algae enters the coral.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	R-7-50	1487	Later, when the zooxanthelle die, so do the coral.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	O	1488	Coral reefs need the temperature of around 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	O	1489	If this temperature were to be drastically changed.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-06031	O	1490	the coral would die off. //
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1491	So you ask what leads to differances in the rates of coral bleaching?
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1492	Well by reading this Story Background on Coral Bleaching I learned that biologists have found that there are more than one kind of corals living in the oceans.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1493	There are the ones that live within the coral polyps which gives the corals there nice colors which is called a (healthy coral.)
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1494	Then it's the the Coral that's all while which would be the bleach ones.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1495	Coral bleaching is phenomenon in which coral loses it's color "words of the story".
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1496	Some biologists feel/say that coral bleaching is a bad Impact on the world's coral reefs which could be proving a fact.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1497	I also learned that corals bleaching is mainly in the pacific ocean and it's affected the land masses around theo cean so it's really not healthy.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1498	Since I talked about Coral bleaching now I would talk about what leads to it and the differences rates.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1499	The things that leads to differeces in rates would have to be water, temperature, Co2 and storms.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	R-1-50	1500	I say this because reef building corals water temperature should be this way because this temperature helps the change colors, if the wind was to increases the corals would not be healthy.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	R-11-14	1501.1	With strom it also makes it not healthy for corals because of the extreme fresh water that comes throu which upsets the corals.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	R-12-14	1501.2	With strom it also makes it not healthy for corals because of the extreme fresh water that comes throu which upsets the corals.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-06114	O	1502	It's so many more things to talk about but I really don't feel like it so I'm done!!! :)//
EBA1415_TWDG_1_CB_ES-04937	O	1503	What lead the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is because coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_TWDG_1_CB_ES-04937	O	1504	The ocean cover about 1/3 of the surface of the entire globe, and contain double the amount of water found.  //
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	O	1505	Rates of coral bleaching differ for various reasons. /
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	O	1506	First off, Coral bleaching is when coral loses its color and turns white.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	O	1507	This makes coral vulnerable to disease and starvation. /
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-3-50	1508	One reason that coral bleaching rates are different is because of water temperature.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	O	1509	Coral need water temps between 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-3-4	1510.1	When water temp increases above that, the amount of CO2 decreases which threatens the corals health. /
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-4-14	1510.2	When water temp increases above that, the amount of CO2 decreases which threatens the corals health. /
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-6-7	1511	Another reason is increased stress.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-6-7	1512	This leads to the coral to rid itself of the algae which gives the coral its color this ridding itself of color. /
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	O	1513	Another reason is death of algae whether it's being later or stepped on by humans/anchors.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-7-50	1514	The death of the algae stops the coral from having color. /
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	O	1515	A final reason would be the the salinity of water.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-11-12	1516.1	As storms increase the amount of fresh water, salinity drops which upsets the balance necessary for coral health. //
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-12-13	1516.2	As storms increase the amount of fresh water, salinity drops which upsets the balance necessary for coral health. //
EBA1415_RCGJ_4a_CB_ES-04684	R-13-14	1516.3	As storms increase the amount of fresh water, salinity drops which upsets the balance necessary for coral health. //
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1517	Many different things can cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1518	Some ways that cause differences are shifting trade winds, ocean salinity, or ejection of algae.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1519	Shifitng trade winds can cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching because upwelling occurs.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1520	Upwelling is the causing of surcace waters to be colder in the western pacific than the eastern Pacific.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1521	This causes major shifts in the world's climate because it causes the central and eastern Pacific to swell which causes seal levels to rise.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1522	This causes coral bleaching to occur.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	R-13-50	1523	Ocean salinity can also cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1524	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	R-11-12	1525.1	When storms occur, the amount of fresh water in the ocean increases, causing the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	R-12-13	1525.2	When storms occur, the amount of fresh water in the ocean increases, causing the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	R-13-14	1526	This decrease in salinity upsets the balance that the coral needs.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	R-7-50	1527.1	Ejection of algae can also cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching, the coral turns white and causes ejection of the zooxanthellae algae it was  carrying.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	R-50-7	1527.2	Ejection of algae can also cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching, the coral turns white and causes ejection of the zooxanthellae algae it was  carrying.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1528	This can also cause death to the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1529	This process causes the coral to be vulnerable and causes starvation.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05357	O	1530	Many different things can cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching.  //
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-1-50	1531	One big affect of coral bleaching are the Trade Winds.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1532	To stay healthy coral need to be kept at 70-85 degrees F because of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1533	Due to Trade Winds, when water is being pushed western the water in the Pacific.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1534	Ocean becomes colder.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1535	Cold water isn't good for coral because the CO2 level decreases and that is used to keep the coral healthy.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1536	So the less Co2 the less likely they'll survive.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-1-3	1537	But if the Trade Winds become altered (happens every few years) the water in the Pacific Ocran becomes 10 degrees F warmer than usual.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-4-50	1538.1	The lack of CO2 cause the coral to lose it's color because of it's lack of nutrients.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-5B-50	1538.2	The lack of CO2 cause the coral to lose it's color because of it's lack of nutrients.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-5B-50	1539	This turns the coral white instead of their natural color.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-11-50	1540	Another thing that affects coral bleaching are storms.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-11-12	1541.1	When there is a huge thunderstorm, too much fresh water is put into the sea which lowers the salinity.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-12-13	1541.2	When there is a huge thunderstorm, too much fresh water is put into the sea which lowers the salinity.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-13-14	1542	Low amounts of salt in sea water threaten the corals health.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	R-7-50	1543	Another way coral becomes bleached is lack of algae.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1544	Algae and coral benefit from eachother for nutrients.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1545	Coral provides an enviorment for the algae, and the algae provides and passes food & nutrients to the coral that it needs to live.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1546	Algae also gives the coral their colors.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05557	O	1547	So if a group of coral didn't have algae, not only would it not get the nutrients it needs, but it will also lose the color that the algae gives the coral. //
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1548	Coral bleaching is an event that happens to coral i nwhich the coral turns white (is bleached) and is more vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-1-50	1549.1	Coral bleaching happens based on Trade winds.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-3-50	1549.2	Coral bleaching happens based on Trade winds.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-11-50	1549.3	Coral bleaching happens based on Trade winds.

EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-11-50	1550.2	Water temperature, and storms./
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1551	Trade winds are wind patterns.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1552	These wind patterns are over the ocean.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1553	They drag warm surface waters westward.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1554	These result in pools of warm water around Australia and Papa New Guinea.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1555	Consequentially, cold waters deep down in the pacific rise to the surface, leaving warm water out the bottom, where the coral is./
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1556	Because, trade winds change the ocean's temperature, there will be same ecological effects Coral, though itself isn't a plant, contains Zooxanthellae which is an algae which uses photosynthesis coral and the zooxanthellae has a dependant relationship.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1557	The coral is dependent on the algae and vise versa.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-4-5	1558	Photosynthesis requires a large amount of Carbon Dioxide.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-3-4	1559	When the water temperature increases, the carbon dioxide amount decreases when kills the algae who need the carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and consequentially warm the coral./
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1560	Finally, a few other factors can efefct health of coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1561	Coral are sensitive to the amount of salt in the water.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-11-12	1562.1	Storms that have a tendencey to add more fresh water and decreases the salt levels are bad for the coral as they are picky.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	R-12-13	1562.2	Storms that have a tendencey to add more fresh water and decreases the salt levels are bad for the coral as they are picky.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1563	Coral can also sustain damage from blast fishing, or tourists walking or dropping anchors on to the coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_CB_ES-04739	O	1564	These are not directly linked to coral bleaching but can cause the coral damage just as well.//
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06100	O	1565	The thing that leads to coral bleaches are multiple things.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06100	O	1566	I say this because there are different things things and living things in the water that gives of certain substances.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06100	R-2-50	1567.1	For, example the ocean water moving from east to west and the different temparatures going in different directions can cause the coral getting bleached.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06100	R-3-50	1567.2	For, example the ocean water moving from east to west and the different temparatures going in different directions can cause the coral getting bleached.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06100	O	1568	Another example is that the sea level is constantly rising anywhere from inches as much as a foot, and the temparature seems to be working together with the rising of sea level.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06100	O	1569	These are some of the passable reasons for "Coral Bleaching".
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05489	O	1570	Changes in the coral environment leads to differences in the rates of cloral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05489	O	1571	I believe that because the documents articles stated "coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship." /
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05489	R-1-50	1572	The trade of wind and photosynthesis have an effect on coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05489	R-13-14	1573	The corals are sensitive to ocean sainty and the drop in sanity upsets the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05489	R-7-50	1574	If the coral health isn't good then the zooxanthellae dies which causes coral bleaches.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05489	O	1575	Therefore the rate of coral bleaching changes based off the environmental causes and unhealthiness.  //
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1576	Coral bleaching is a scientific phenomenon that entails coral losing color therefore becoming 'bleached'.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1577	Many different environmental stressors can cause coral to become bleached.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1578	These can include, things naturally occuring and things caused by human interference. /
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1579	One thing that causes coral bleaching is the temperature of the water the coral is the coral is Algae called zooxanthellae live within the limestone exoskilotons of coral polyps; using photosynthesis to feed both themselves and the coral .
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1580	These algae are also the things that give ocral their bright, radiant colors.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	R-3-5	1581.1	However, when the temperature of the ocean is warmer, the process of photosynthesis becomes harder, and as a result, zooanthellae start to die, taking away a vital food source for coral, causing it to become sick and discolored.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	R-5-7	1581.2	However, when the temperature of the ocean is warmer, the process of photosynthesis becomes harder, and as a result, zooanthellae start to die, taking away a vital food source for coral, causing it to become sick and discolored.

EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	R-3-50	1582	A sudden spike in temperature in 1998 caused a significant increase in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	R-1-3	1583	This spike in temperature was caused by the shifting of trade winds.  /
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1584	Coral can also be harmde by humans interference
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04994	O	1585	Things such as blast fishing and tourism can bring trauma to coral when tourists drop anchors on coral reefs, they damage it, making coral bleaching more likely.  /

EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05324	O	1641	For example, algae (zooxanthallae) live with teh coral, they contribute to the coloration of the coral and the coral obtains food from them.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05324	R-3-5	1642	The coral reefs are most noticeable in the pacific, as the waters are warmer, etc. & it allows for algae to undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05324	R-1-3	1643	However, in the pacific shifting trade winds occur (it can potentially shift water temperatures.)
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05324	O	1644	This affects coral because as algae turn Co2 and H2O into sugar and O2 for the coral the temperature could then affect how much glucose is being produced.

EBA1415_TRDJ_11_CB_ES-05716	O	1674	One lead is that their is different types of corals living in the oceans.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_CB_ES-05716	O	1675	This means that their is just not one coral, but more different types of corales.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_CB_ES-05716	O	1676	The second lead is these invertebrate animals live together in colonies.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_CB_ES-05716	O	1677	The corals live in one place together, there are multiple corals.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_CB_ES-05716	O	1678	The third lead is there are some coral that are been bleached.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_CB_ES-05716	O	1679	The fourth lead is coral bleaching is a phenomenon.  //
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06152	R-4-50	1680	The differences that leads rates of coral bleachings is that they don't get enough sunlight and doest have a normal amount of Co2.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06152	R-11-50	1681	Another way corals get bleached is by extreme storms because corals are very sensitive and on how salty the water is.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06152	R-11-12	1682.1	If the storms increases the amount of fresh water in the ocean, it can cause the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06152	R-12-13	1682.2	If the storms increases the amount of fresh water in the ocean, it can cause the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06152	R-13-14	1683	So if the salinity drops the coral gets upset and loses its balance necessary for coral health.//
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1684	Some things that lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the water.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1685	The water usually changes the algae color bleaches it plain white.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	R-1-3	1686	Another reason is the wind the wind could change the water of the ocean, for example it can go slow, it could make the water go more and have waves.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1687	Some other example is the sun, because the sun could hit the water and the algae and it could make it change color by how hot or cold the sun is.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1688	Another reason is it could just be the lagae because it just wants to change color by itself and it transforming to another color.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1689	In conclusion I think the purpose of the algae changing color is the water, the sun, the waves and also it could be by it self that it changes it's own color.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1690	But it could also be the climat how hot or cold it could be.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1691	One more reason is the animals, the animals because they could leave trash in the water or food and the algae can inharm it and could change colors.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05680	O	1692	thats why I think is the reason for the color bleaching. //
EBA1415_TRDJ_2_CB_ES-06127	R-7-50	1693	Coral bleaching is when the zooxanthellae balance is effected, and it turns the coral white.//

EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06118	O	1695	You have to know what coral bleaching is./
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06118	O	1696	Coral bleaching is when coral lose their color and turn white.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06118	O	1697	The reason this happens is because the zooxanthellae algae that helps to keep it alive are ejected and some of the algae die./
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06118	O	1698	However many zooxanthellae algae die or are ejected plays a big role in the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06118	R-7-14	1699	The more algae that die, the more unhealthy the coral become.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06118	R-14-50	1700	As the coral begin to get even more unhealthy the more color it loses.//
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1701	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is that it is very noticable in the Pacific ocean.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1703	Coral bleaching could lead on how it can affect the bleached relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae. /
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1704	To begin with, As it says in the document coral bleaching is most noticable in the Pacific ocean.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1705	The ocran covers about 1/3 of the surface of the entire globe, and contains double the amount of water in the Atlantic Ocean.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1706	With this being said, most costal regions in the Pacific Ocean are affected by coral bleaching./
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1707	Also, many corals are sensitive to ocean salnity which is salt water.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	R-11-13	1708	It states in the document, "Salinity can decrease in shallow costal regions during storms that cause excessive rainfall, like hurricanes or tropical storms.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	R-11-12	1709.1	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	R-12-13	1709.2	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1710	So this statement is meaning that with this drop of salinity can affect the coral health. /
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	R-7-50	1711	Last, as we have read that during bleaching corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05424	O	1712	This can affect and lead corals to disease and starvation.

EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	O	1722	Since coral are sensitive as said in the text there are a number of things that lead to differences in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	O	1723	One of the reasons is trade wind.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	O	1724	It creats upwelling that is harmful to coral, because coral need a specific temperature range to thrive.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	O	1725	Upwelling can increase the temperature by 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	O	1726	Another reason is zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	R-4-50	1727	This algae helps the coral survive and like in shallow water if the CO2 levels arent right then the coral is in trouble.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	R-4-50	1728	In other words if the CO2 levels are even slightly to low it wil put the coral at a higher risk of bleaching.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	O	1729	Another lead is extreme weather.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	R-11-12	1730.1	Extreme storms such as hurricanes can decrease the salinity in the water.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05795	R-11-13	1730.2	Extreme storms such as hurricanes can decrease the salinity in the water.

EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05481	O	1738	What leads to differences in rate of coral bleaching are many things, one of which is when warmer water reach the cold water, it's called the upwelling.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05481	O	1739	That's when the Eastern Pacific causes surface waters to be colder.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05481	R-1-2	1740	The wind has a big factor in this, trade winds reverse of weaken direction to blow from West to East and that causes warm water to be dragged Eastern towards South America.//

EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1779	Coral Bleaching is when coral looses its color.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1780	And it really impacts the worlds coral reefs.  /
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	R-1-50	1781	One cause of coral Bleeching is shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1782	Shifting Trade Winds is the wind in the ocean out at sea.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1783	It causes water to be cooler than usual.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1784	It alters winds.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1785	And Also rises sea levels, sea levels could be risen as much as a foot.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1786	It shifts the worlds climate.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1787	And as a result all of these things can cause coral bleeching.  /
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1788	Zooxanthelae and corals have a relationship that they both benefit from.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1789	Coral cannot live without zooxanthalae, because then their is not enough photosynthesis in the water to live.  /
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1790	Photosynthesis also shapes a corals life.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05107	O	1791	Photosynthesis energy from sunlight combined with carbon Dioxide in the ocean water.

EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-1-50	1794	The cause of the differences in rates of coral bleaching is the strength of the trade winds.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-1-3	1795	Trade winds are winds that make the water in the western Pacific Ocean warmer than the water in the eastern Pacific.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-1-3	1796	Sometimes, every few years, the trade winds aren't as strong as before or they blow from west to east, which makes the eastern Pacific water warmer than the western Pacific.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	O	1797	Since this isn't a change a lot of animals are used to, some can't adjust to the trade winds pace or direction.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	O	1798	This is especially life-treatening to the coral in the sea because a process with zooxanthellae (type of algae) is very sensitive to temperature changes.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-6-7	1799	If this happens, the environment will put stress on the coral, which makes the coral take out the algae that is giving it food.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-5B-7	1800.1	Without the algae inside the coral, both of them could potentially die, with the algae dying from not enough nutrients and the corals turn white from having no algae living in it and could eventually die.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-7-50	1800.2	Without the algae inside the coral, both of them could potentially die, with the algae dying from not enough nutrients and the corals turn white from having no algae living in it and could eventually die.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-3-4	1801.1	All this happens because of the warmer water do not having a lot of carbon dioxide for the coral to stay healthy and produce photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	R-4-5	1801.2	All this happens because of the warmer water do not having a lot of carbon dioxide for the coral to stay healthy and produce photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_CB_ES-05898	O	1802	This can be proven on one of the documents which clearly shows how a certain year had warm water and that was also the year that had the most coral deaths.  //

EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	R-1-3	1806	According to the article, Shifting trade winds, Trade winds help oceans keep their right temperatures.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	R-1-3	1807	However, every couple of years Trade Winds change directios; causing ocean's temperature to change durastically.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	O	1808	Coral reefs are found more in clear, warm water so when the temperature changes it effects the reefs.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	O	1809	This is because the zooxanthellae that lives in the coral tissues needs warm, clear water to be able to do the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	R-5-50	1810	If the isn't able to do photosynthesis, it may start too bleach.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	R-6-50	1811	This is considered an environmental stressor, which coral is highly sensitive to, therefore these stressors can potentially kill the coral reefs. /
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04795	R-1-50	1812	To conclude, we need to find a way to alter the trade winds or else coral will continue to bleach and die.

EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05343	O	1867	To add on to that the water temps affected the corals "Photosynthesis" process which the coral needs to be healthy.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05343	R-3-4	1868.1	The high temps cause the Carbon Dioxide in the water to decrease and CO2 is needed to complete the process called "Photosynthesis," which helps the coral to maintian healthy.

EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05343	O	1869	Zooxanthallae is a huge effect on coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05343	O	1870	Once the zooxanthallae starts to die it affects the coral because zooxanthallae passes food that they obtained from the sun onto the corals.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05343	O	1871	Without the sun's energy or food the coral will start to bleach and continue to bleach in till they are all white.  //
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05308	R-7-50	1872	There are ways the coral bleaching could happen.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05308	R-7-50	1873	It occurs when ejection or death of the zooxanthellae when this happen to coral makes itself vulnerable to diseases and starvation.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05308	O	1874	The way it recovers it get is energy  back from sun carbon and oxygen.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05308	R-1-50	1875.1	In 1998 there was very low wind strength and high water Temperature made 16% of the coral get bleached, but when there is high trade win and lower temperature the zooxanthellae has a higher changer to live in it's daily life.

EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1883	What leads to differences in the rates of coloral bleaching coud because some polyps sea water isn't filled with enough limestone.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1884	They need limestone from seawater in order to build a hard skeleton.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1885	which would not allow polyps to build up their skeletons to form coral reefs.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1886	Coral reefs are rare because they are only found in clear Tropical Waters.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1887	Also another reason is becaus the same waters there isn't alot of algae (zooxanthellae) inside the coral tissues.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1888	Coral have to recieve light in order to make the process run smoothly.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1889	Coral and zooxanthellae algae have a (symbiotic relationship).
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1890	Coral bleach is one example of enviormental stressors.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1891	This is some thing that can affect the relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1892	Some can protect themselves to keep coral bleaching from performing.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	R-7-50	1893	Coral bleaching is a form of death or ejection.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1894	Coral bleaching is an event that makes coral vulnerable to disease and stravtion.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1895	Only because coral once aging is an animal.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05897	O	1896	Another rate is that some can recover from events.  //
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1897	Coral bleaching differs alot from year to year.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1898	For example one year coral bleaching in our oceans might be extremely high, and the next numbers might significanlty drop.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1899	Many could come to the conclusion that this might be because of our destructive practices such as boats and tourists.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1900	But I have come to the conclusion that the reason we have so much differences in the amount of coral bleaching might have something to do with the environment, one of the reasons might have been shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	R-1-3	1901	Normally our trade winds blow from east to west but every few years they are altered, meaning they change direction or weaken.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	R-1-3	1902.1	In most cases this causes our oceans swell and the temperature rises.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	R-3-50	1902.2	In most cases this causes our oceans swell and the temperature rises.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	R-3-50	1903	This is more severly seen along the equatorial regions, which might help us explain the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1904	These negative effects could be considered enviommental stressors, which threaten the relationship of coral and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1905	The algae rely on the coral in order to stay healthy.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1906	Since enviornmental stressors are different in every region, negative effects such as bleaching become more indigious to certain areas.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1907	The last reason of differences in the rates of bleaching  would have to be the coral itself.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1908	Some corals bleach and die off while others are able to recover and continue thriving.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05493	O	1909	In conclusion, differences in the rates of coral bleaching are a result of many varieties of enviromental stressors. //
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05491	O	1910	what I think is leading the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is all the upwelling in the eastern pacific which causes the surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05491	R-3-5	1911	In the article Coral and Photosynthesis it states "Reef building corals needs water temperature between 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature."
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05491	O	1912	In another article named Coral and Zooxantheallae it takes "the most dangerous threats to the health of corals are those that are caused by changes. 	Ran out of time//
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1913	Many things lead to the different rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1914	Changes in the amount of Co2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-3-4	1915	As water temperature increases, the amount of carbon Dioxide (CO2) in water decreases.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-3-4	1916	This means that the more warm the water is, the less carbon Dioxide is in the water.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1917	Reef building corals need water temeperature in between 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-11-14	1918	Extreme storms can also threaten the balance too.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1919	Corals are sensitive to oceans salinity.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1920	Salinity is how salty the water is.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-11-13	1921	In storms that cause excessive rainfall, salinity can decrease.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-11-12	1922.1	The storms can increase the amount of fresh water which the causes salinity to decrease in the ocean.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-12-13	1922.2	The storms can increase the amount of fresh water which the causes salinity to decrease in the ocean.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1923	Blast fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs doesn't help keeping the corals healthy as thearticle "coral and zooxanthallae" started.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1924	Other cause are changes in the envrionment.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-6-7	1925	This puts stress on corals then the coral has to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	R-7-50	1926	During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1927	This makes corals vunerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1928	Some reefs may recover, but most don't.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05158	O	1929	A colorful reef is better and healthier than a bleached coral. //
EBA1415_RCGJ_4_CB_ES-04680	O	1930	Coral is an animal without a backbone.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4_CB_ES-04680	O	1931	They live in groups and don't move much.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4_CB_ES-04680	O	1932	Coral bleaching happens near the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_RCGJ_4_CB_ES-04680	R-1-50	1933	Coral bleaching is due to Shifting trade winds cause a rise in sea water in the Pacific which cause coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-04893	O	1934	The lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is how much sun light it recieves.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-04893	R-1-3	1935	I think this because the graph on the "Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching" articles shows that when there is less trade wind to protect the water from the sun, it gets warmer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-04893	O	1936	This is a sign that the sun is affecting the water and the things living in them.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-04893	R-3-50	1937	The second graph shows that when the water was the warmest, it was the year when the most coral bleaching happened.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-04893	O	1938	Ran out of time  //
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	R-1-50	1939	I think low trade wind strength leads to high rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	R-3-5	1940	I think this, because the coral needs 70-85 degrees F temperature to use photosunthesis and the trade winds help disperse the water across the coral reefs.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	O	1941	But, when the trade winds have low strength, they can't get enough water to the right places. /
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	O	1942	I also think that water temperature's matter too.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	R-1-50	1943.1	For example, the only time severe coral bleaching happened was when there was a huge difference between wind strengths and water temperature.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	R-3-50	1943.2	For example, the only time severe coral bleaching happened was when there was a huge difference between wind strengths and water temperature.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	O	1944	So I think that the wind strengths and water temperature must be close together to minimize cloral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	R-3-50	1945	My example is that in 1998, the strengths and water temperature had a huge difference and resultedin the most severe coral bleaching on the graph.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05925	R-1-50	1946.1	But, in 1981, the wind strengths and water temperature was close enough to cause fairly little coral bleaching. //

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05604	O	1949	Coral bleaching is when a coral has lost its color so it turns all white.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05604	R-1-50	1950	The rates on cloral bleaching depend on the Trade Winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05604	R-1-2	1951	Since trade winds drag warm water to the oceans the surface water in the Eastern Pacific turn out to be colder.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05604	R-3-50	1952	this can decrease the temperature rates where the and if they dont have the temperature coral is 70-80F to lower than 10F and thats when the coral reefs will start bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05604	O	1953	Corals are really sensitive so with that they can cause storms.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05604	O	1954	That why the number of countries reporting coral bleaching goes higher. //
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04697	O	1955	Coral bleaching is the discoloration of the coral from its original color to white.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04697	O	1956	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral looses its color.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04697	O	1957	In the article it says that coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04697	R-1-3	1958	In the ocean whenever the trade wind streagth goes down the water temperature goes up.

EBA1415_UTKZ_1_CB_ES-05759	O	1966	This combination results in the formation of sugars and oxygen.
EBA1415_UTKZ_1_CB_ES-05759	O	1967	As this is occuring, carbon is passed from algae to the coral in the form of glucose.
EBA1415_UTKZ_1_CB_ES-05759	R-4-5	1968	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415_UTKZ_1_CB_ES-05759	O	1969	That's important because the chemicals that the algae make provide the coral with energy it needs to survive.
EBA1415_UTKZ_1_CB_ES-05759	O	1970	Coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae. //
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05665	O	1971	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is when the coral loses its color.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	O	1977	There are many variables that can explain what leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	O	1978	One reasonable explanation can be the charges in the enviornment.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	O	1979	Along with extreme storms and change in water temperatures.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	O	1980	A big main reason is the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae. /
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	O	1981	A change in the environment is something that occurs in nature on its own.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	O	1982	For example, reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85F.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	R-11-50	1985	Another explanation to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the cause of extreme storms.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05588	R-11-13	1986	This affects corals by salinity decreasing in shallow coastal regions during storms that cause excessie rainfall during storms or tropical storms.

EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05061	O	2007	Coral also hasn't been getting all the nutrients they need.
EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05061	O	2008	Changes in the enviorment cause coral to eject there "food producing algae".
EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05061	O	2009	This causes them to have a lack in food.
EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05061	R-7-50	2010	When the zooxanthellae algae dies or get's ejected this causes the coral to bleach.//
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2011	Although coral bleaching may seem like a new skin trend it isn't.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2012	Coral bleaching is actually the lightning of a coral's exterior.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2013	The most common bleached color is white.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2014	It is called coral bleaching because this is not always natural process.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2015	Other animals as well as humans can cause the corals to bleach themselves causes it all depends on three things.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2016	Those things are who lives in the area, what type of activities they are partaking in, and where the specific coral is.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2017	You may ask yourself why does it matter who lives around the coral's body of water.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2018	It matters because it is in with what activity they are doing.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2019	The article "Coral and zooxanthalle states that certain activites such as blast fishing or walking on the plant could harm it.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2020	If the coral lives in area/ where people partake intenese.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2021	In thesse activities bt are definetly at risk,
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2022	Bringing the back to my to my third reason "Where", sunlight and weather patterns according to the source "Reef base. org" on June 2013 a thing called trade wind which are breefly described as the mixture of hot and cols moisture.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	R-1-50	2023	The graphs show that when trade wind strength is low such as it was in 1998 coral bleaching reports were high.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	R-6-50	2024	In conclusion there are many different causes of coral bleaching which was previosly described as lightning in color of a coral due to enviornmental "stressors".
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2025	The factors were weather, growth, human activity.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04747	O	2026	We must become aware of the at risk corals and be more cautious. //
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05144	O	2027	Coral Bleaching is when a coral is losing its color and starts trying.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05144	O	2028	The trade winds seems to be affect By this when it spreads the trade winds seem to follow.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05144	R-1-5	2029	It possible with the corals lack of photosynthesis it made the water cooler letting trade winds go by.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05144	O	2030	Thse coral are mostly affect of extream weather and other thing is realed to people.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05144	O	2031	in both 1998 The Bleaching and trade winds Both had a suddon spive making the trade wids weak. //
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06066	O	2032	Coral bleaching is when the coral turns white.//
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06066	O	2033	Diden't get to finish
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	R-1-50	2034	What can lead to differences for coral bleaching can be shifting wind trades, coral & photosynthesis, coral and zooxanthellae, or human/world causes.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2035	Trade winds travel east to west.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2036	But in some cases the warm water start to rise.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2037	Sea levels and water temperatures can also rise as water temperature increases.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2038	The ammount of Carbon Dioxide decreases.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2039	Changes threaten balance required to keep coral healthy.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2040	Algae in corla or known as zooxanthellae uses the process for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	R-4-5	2041	During photosynthesis, zooxanthellae uses energy from sunligt to combine Carbon Dioxdie.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	R-4-50	2042	If the ammount of Carbon Dioxxide is low, it can be a problem for coral.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2043	There are many ways corals are harmed but the most caused changes is enviormnetal problems.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2044	Corals from enviornment forces are forced to eject their food producing algae or zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2045	Zooxanthellae and coral both supply each other with food.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	R-7-50	2046	During bleaching, the corals turns white due to ejection or death of zooxanthellage algae.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05441	O	2047	Bleaching causes corals vulnerable for diseases or stravation.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05657	O	2048	Coral bleaching occurs because the zooxanthellae algae 	//
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2049	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2050	Cloral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2051	Cloral is often mistakened for a rock or plant.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2052	But however, it is really made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2053	It has a saclike body and a mouth surrounded by stinging testacles.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2054	Another fact about clorals is that their reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2055	This is partly because algae, called zooxanthellae, live in teh coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	R-3-5	2056	Reef building clorals need water temperatures between 70-85oF because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2057	Corals are also sensitive to coean salinity (how salty the water is).
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2058	Corals and zooxanthellae alage have a symbotic relationship.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2059	That means that they both benefit from their relationship with each other.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-04908	O	2060	In fact, most zooxanthellae cannot live outside of the coral animals body.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05192	R-3-1	2061	I have began to notice that when water temperature rises there becomes weaker trade winds.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05192	R-1-50	2062	With weaker trade winds the more coral bleaching incidents.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05192	O	2063	If there were total less trade winds the water temperature would be lower.//
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-06098	O	2064	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching//
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05690	R-7-50	2065	Well the coral bleaching is mostly led by the death or ejection of the zooxanthellae algea. So it turns white due to the death or ejection of the algae.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05690	R-14-50	2066.1	An example of the coral bleaching is on how the envionmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05690	R-6-14	2066.2	An example of the coral bleaching is on how the envionmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05690	O	2067	Also shows on the results in a bleaching event that makes corals vulnerable to disease and also starvation. //
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05642	O	2068	Marine biologist have discovered many different types of corals living in the oceans.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05642	O	2069	These invertbrate animals live together in colonies and tend to stay in one place.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05642	R-7-50	2070	The different types of algae living within the coral polyps give the corals their varying colors.  //
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2071	Coral bleaching is when the animals has no color.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2072	Some are just plain white.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	R-7-50	2073	There is different types of algae living within the coral polyps give the coral their varaying colors.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2074	The coral bleaching has caused a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2075	One possibility of the differences of leads could be the tempeture of the water.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	R-14-50	2076.1	Coral bleachins is also an example of how envionmental stressors can negatively affect the balance relationship betwin the coral zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	R-6-14	2076.2	Coral bleachins is also an example of how envionmental stressors can negatively affect the balance relationship betwin the coral zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	R-7-50	2077	The difrences could be caused because since the coral is made of zooxanthellae, they can die what would cause the coral to look plain white.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2078	Some corals recover but some just don't.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2079	Another lead that might cause the difrence is the type of water they live in since coral reefs are only found in clear tropical waters.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2080	Another option is the way the coral uses energy by using the photoseatisic process which would allow the coral to use energy from the sun to combine carbon dioxide.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05905	O	2081	in the ocean whit the water in the process carbon is passed from the algie to the coral which might cause the difrent coral color of a white plain. //
