EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	O	140	THere are 3 main ones that cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	O	141	For example:  basal cell carcinoma, squomous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	O	142	Humans have demonstrated harmful effects of exposure to uvb radiation.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	O	143	Uvb radiation is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	R-3-4	144	Researchers have found that when the skin is hit with normal amounts of uvb radiation, the rays cause small amounts of damage.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	O	145	However problems arise when there is excessive exposure to uvb radiation.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	R-4-5	146	On the other hand sunburn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	R-5-6	147	Sun burn occurs when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	R-5-6	148.1	Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	R-6-50	148.2	Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	R-1-2	149	In addition, depending on location, amount of direct sunlight may vary a lot or a little throughout the year.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05668	O	150	So people who live closer to the equator need to be more aware of sunlight than others who don't.

EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-4-50	185	Risks of developing skin cancer are many.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-4-50	186	One cause is damage to skin cells.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-4-6	187	If skin cells are damaged, the body sends blood to repair or remove those damaged cells.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-6-50	188	If some cells are not removed, that can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-1-50	189	Another risk factor is where you are located geographically.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-1-2	190	If you are closer to the equator, there will be more direct sunlight on you.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	O	191	Thank you.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	O	192	Oh, you too.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	O	193	Anyway there are many more risk factors, which I will detail below./
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	O	194	The pigment of your skin is a factor.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-11-12	195.1	The skin produces melanin, which protects your skin from solar radiation.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-12-3	195.2	The skin produces melanin, which protects your skin from solar radiation.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	O	196	Different people have different amounts of melanin.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-11-12	197	The more melanin you have, the more protected you will be, but you will produce less vitamin D./
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-1-50	198	Again, your location is a big factor.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-1-2	199.1	The clsoer you are to direct sunlight (like Southern USA) the more risk there is of developing sunburn and aquiring some sort of skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05560	R-2-5	199.2	The clsoer you are to direct sunlight (like Southern USA) the more risk there is of developing sunburn and aquiring some sort of skin cancer.

EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-2-50	204	The main thins that cause a person of having skin cancer is mostly the sun.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-2-50	205	The closer and more your in the sun the higher chance that you'll have skin cancer.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	O	206	Another way of having skin cancer from the sun is having a sunburn.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-5-6	207	A sunburn that is severe enough its not likely all damage skin cells will be removed.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-5-6	208.1	Sunburn skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-6-50	208.2	Sunburn skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-3-50	209	Also to much exposure to uvb radiation may cause skin cancer as well.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	R-5-50	210	Another way you develop skin cancer is if you were exposed to a severe sunburn as a child you can develope skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_ERSK_1_SC_ES-05780	O	211	Most commonly people tan a lot so that's also a way of developing skin cancer, expecially is you don't put on sunscreen.//
EBA1415_ERAM_1_SC_ES-04954	R-5-50	212	Skin cancer can be developed when you get severe sunburns.

EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC-06238	O	221	The earth's tilt matters because of the direction of sunlight.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC-06238	R-2-50	222	It is mostly duringthe summer time where the chance of getting skin cancer is raised because of the tilt of the earth towards the sun.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC-06238	R-2-50	223	With less sunlight, the chance is at a lower level then it there was more sunlight.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC-06238	O	224	The sun's rays contain U.V rays which are harmful to your skin.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC-06238	O	225	They are the reason why skin has become a large issue as it is.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC-06238	R-11-12	226	Even though your skin does have melanin helping defend against these rays, it isn't enough to stop it for a long duration. /

EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	235	Skin cancer can be caused by many things.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	236	Skin cancer is caused when your body has a large number of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	237	Some people are more at risk than others.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	238	You have the chance to provent skin cancer, but everyone is at risk a little bit./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	239	You can provent skin cancer in a couple ways.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	240	First, stay out of the sun as much as possible.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	241	Sunburns are a large spot of damaged cells.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-5-6	242	In the article it states, "Sunburns happen when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells." 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-5-6	243.1	You don't want this to occur because this gives you the risk of your cells not healing and this may cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-6-50	243.2	You don't want this to occur because this gives you the risk of your cells not healing and this may cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-1-50	244	Another way to lower your chances is to live farther away from the equator.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-1-2	245	This will help because in the article it says, "...the closer you are to the Equator, the more consistent direct sunlight will be."
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-1-2	246	If you live farther away you will get less direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-12-3	247	Your skin can protect a lot for you but not UVb, sunlight.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	R-1-3	248	So by living some where away from the equator you will recieve less UVb.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	249	I would suggest after looking at the data from "skin cancer incidence by latitude" you can live anywhere but I wouldn't suggest the latitude 35-45 because it is close to the equator.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	250	This is just another way to prevent skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	251	These options give you ways to lower the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	252	You should stay out of the sun and try to live farther from the equator. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	253	Make sure to check your skin for signs of differing skin because it is good to catch skin cancer at an early stage.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04869	O	254	These are important things to do to help prevent skin cancer.//
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	255	The damage of skin known as skin cancer is caused by a variety of exponents.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-3-50	256	Skin cancer can be caused by the radiation from the sun, mitosis, and too much vitamin D./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-2-3	257	First of all, when an individual spends too much time out in the sun, it's UV rays can harm the person.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-3-4	258.1	According to national geographic, "skin is harmed by the UV radiation released from the sun." 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-2-3	258.2	According to national geographic, "skin is harmed by the UV radiation released from the sun." 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-2-50	259	Sports such as basketball are played outside in heat for a long duration.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-2-50	260	People can get skin cancer from this since the sun exposes the human body.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	261	Skin cancer makes red dense patches in your skin.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	262	Mitosis also plays a role in skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	263	Secondly, mitosis is the duplication of somatical skin cells. 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	264	When cells enter interphase, they get ready to create a new cell which is identical.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	265	To add, cancer means rapid uncontrollable replication of cells.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	266	You may wondering where I'm going.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	267	Well, when some cells ""catch" skin cancer, the cancerous part makes them replicate like crazy.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	268	This causes cells all around your body to become cancerous./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	269	Lastly, immense vitamin D can cause slight chances of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	270	Even though vitamin D is a crutial part in our body since it makes our bones strong, it lacks space for melanin.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	271	"Melanin is a special pigment produced in the epidermis" says national geographic.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-11-12	272.1	Melanin protects our skin from skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-12-50	272.2	Melanin protects our skin from skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	273	The problem is that the lack of melanin makes it easier for our body to produce vitamin D.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-11-12	274.1	Therefore, too much vitamin D can cause lack of melanin which makes us more prone to skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-12-50	274.2	Therefore, too much vitamin D can cause lack of melanin which makes us more prone to skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	R-2-50	275	As you can see, skin cancer can be caused by the sun, mitosis, and immense vitamin D. 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-04892	O	276	This key terms all play a crucial aspect in skin cancer.//
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	O	277	The cause of skin cancer has many different ways of occuring.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	O	278	One is the different types of skin cells that reproduce irregularly.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	O	279	The growth of abnormal skin cells can lead to basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, & malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	R-2-50	280	Another factor in developing skin cancer is the amount of direct sunlight the skin obtains.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	R-1-2	281.1	The location can determine this because if one is closer to the equator the more consistent direct sunlight there will be.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	R-2-50	281.2	The location can determine this because if one is closer to the equator the more consistent direct sunlight there will be.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	R-2-50	282	(This will increase the chance of skin cancer)
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	R-3-4	283	The UVb radiation in the sun's rays is what causes small amount of damage to genetic molecules in skin cells. (Our body can repare this).
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	O	284	However, if the person has a large amount of exposure to UVb radiation a problem can occur.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05506	O	285	All in all you can still go out & enjoy the sun but make sure you use proper protection & check for any tell tale signs of developing skin cancer.//

EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04733	O	333	Melanin is a pigment produced on the outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04733	R-11-12	334.1	Less melinin means we have less protection from UVb radiation.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04733	R-12-3	334.2	Less melinin means we have less protection from UVb radiation.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04733	R-1-50	335	There are also risks associated with where you live.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04733	R-1-2	336.1	People who live clsoer to the equator are more at risk because of heigtened sun exposure.

EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-2-50	341	What I think leads to the development of Skin cancer is overexposure to sunlight.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-2-4	342.1	I think when the sun damages the majority of skin cells on a person they develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-4-50	342.2	I think when the sun damages the majority of skin cells on a person they develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-2-50	343	I also think skin cancer is affecting people in warmer climate because of the amount of sunlight they recive.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-1-2	344	The closer you are to the equator, the harsher the heat.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-1-3	345.1	I can infer that, people that live on the equator have harsher UV rays.
EBA1415_TRDJ_11_SC_ES-06134	R-3-50	345.2	I can infer that, people that live on the equator have harsher UV rays.

EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05132	O	347	What leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05132	O	348	It may surprise you to learn that the skin on our bodies is our largest organ.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05132	O	349	It covers every region of our bodies in order to protect our inner tissue from ifection and loss of water.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05132	O	350	There are numerous skin disorders, conditions, and diseases.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05132	O	351	Of these, skin cancer is among the most feared because everyone is at some risk of developing skin cancer.//
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	O	352	Everyone has a possibility of developing skin cancer, but some people are at greater risk.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-1-2	353	To star off, people living in areas with the most direct sunlight have a greater chance of getting sun exposure.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-1-3	354.1	Generally speaking, the areas with the most direct sunlight, and the most Uvb radiation are near the equator.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-1-2	354.2	Generally speaking, the areas with the most direct sunlight, and the most Uvb radiation are near the equator.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	O	355	As seen on the graph, areas that were 30o north of the equator had almost 600,000 skin cancer incidents, while areas 55o north of the equator had around 150,000 skin cancer incidents.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-3-6	356	Secondly, when there is excessive exposure to Uvb radiation, the skin able to repair itself.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-11-12	357.1	The body's defense against solar radiation is melanin.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-12-3	357.2	The body's defense against solar radiation is melanin.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-11-12	358.1	Having less melanin also decreases the chance of being protected from the UV rays, increasing the chance of getting skin cancer.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	O	359	While the body repairs the damaged cells, and replaces them with new ones, blood often rushese to this area.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	O	360	This is most commonly known as sunburn.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-5-6	361.1	If these sunburned cells aren't removed, this causes skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-6-50	361.2	If these sunburned cells aren't removed, this causes skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-5-6	362	With a more severe-sunburn, it becomes more likely that all of the cells don't get removed.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	R-5-50	363	However, the damage can start early on if a serious sunburn occurs in childhood or adolescence the chances of developing skin cancer double.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05532	O	364	Skin cancer is something that everyone can get, but some people are at much higher of a risk.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	O	365	Skin cancer is caused in many ways that we expiernce everyday.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	O	366	We take risks everyday that can develop into some form of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	R-1-50	367	The risk of getting skin cancer is also based off where you live.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	O	368	Depending on the latitude of your home its a petial risk.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	R-1-50	369	The united states latitude causes skin cancer to be the most common form of cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	R-2-50	370	Also because of sunlight the risk of skin cancer is higher depending on your sunburn.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04734	R-5-6	371.1	The worse your sunburn the less chance of cells reproducing which develops into skin cancer.

EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	413	Skin cancer is caused by many different reasons. But if you get a clue that you are getting skin cancer it can be easier to get rid of it at early stages.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	414	Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	415	Skin cancer is actually the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-1-50	416	One reason why you develop skin cancer is if you live close to the equator.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-1-2	417	If you live close to it you are more consistent to direct sunlight.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-1-2	418	Some locations like the northern third of Australia and southern parts of the United States have moderate to extreme levels of year-round direct sunlight.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	419	There are three main varieties of skin cancer a person can develop.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	420	They are Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma./
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-5-50	421	Another reason for skin cancer is sunburns.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-4-5	422	Sunburn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-5-6	423	Sunburns happen when the body directs blood to the skin to try to repair damaged cells.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-5-6	424.1	Sunburn skincells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	R-6-50	424.2	Sunburn skincells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	425	Sunburns frequently include a painful burning sensations.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	426	The severity of sensations depends on the severity of the burn.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	427	Severe sunburn is called sun poisoning which can lead to infection, shock or even death in severe cases.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	428	Did you know that skin is by far the body's largest organ.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	429	The skin is composed of 3 layers.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	430	The outermost epidermis, the middle dermis, and innermost subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05201	O	431	So you better be caeful from heat it can harm you and your body and always wear sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses if there is lots of sunlight outside.//
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-2-50	432	My explanation for skin cancer cause is.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-2-50	433	The over exposure to sun.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-2-50	434	Many causes that I am aware of are of skin cancer come from the sun.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	O	435	The skin cancer itself is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-3-50	436	Also the verity of skin cancer that develops depends on the type of skin cells that reproduce.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-3-50	437	Many studies have been done on skin cancer and what causes it studies have shown uvb radiation is the main cause.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	O	438	Uvb radiation is a type of solar radiation solar means sun.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-2-50	439	This all comes back to me conclusion that sun is the major cause of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-4-5	440	Sunburn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05619	R-5-50	441.1	Sunburn can become severe in which the case one of the severities is skin cancer is burned skin cells are not removed can result in skin cancer.//

EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-5477_9	O	444	There are many numerous skin disorders conditions and diseases.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-5477_9	R-2-50	445.1	That can cause skin cancer and many of us take our skin for granted and do our skin wrong for many ways.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-5477_9	R-1-50	445.2	That can cause skin cancer and many of us take our skin for granted and do our skin wrong for many ways.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-5477_9	R-1-50	446.1	For example, the latitude and direct sunlight.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-5-50	458	There are many ways to develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-5-50	459	The main cause, sunburns.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-3-5	460	Sunburns are caused by to much exposure to uvb rays.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-2-3	461	Uvb rays are rays given off by the sun.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-3-4	462	To much exposure causes the molecules in skin cells to get damaged.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-4-6	463	Our bodies can repair a good amt of it, but faced with too much it won't be able to repair all of it.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-6-50	464	If it's not repaired it can lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	O	465	Skin cancer is a disease where there is abnormal growth in skin cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	O	466	That's because those specific cells are now damaged and considered abnormal.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-5-50	467	The higher the chances of skin cancer go up if you suffer sunburns (serious) as a child or adolescence.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-5-50	468	That is a main reason you develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	O	469	But its risk varies by the person.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-1-2	470.1	The people who live closer to the equator have a higher risk b/c they are exposed to direct sunlight more often then those not near the equator.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-2-50	470.2	The people who live closer to the equator have a higher risk b/c they are exposed to direct sunlight more often then those not near the equator.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	O	471	Another factor is the amount of melanin the skin has.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-11-12	472.1	Melanin helps defend against solar radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05509	R-12-3	472.2	Melanin helps defend against solar radiation.

EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	O	479	Since skin is our biggest organ, we should try to take care of it.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-1-50	480	There are many differences in the risk to develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-1-50	481	One of the main difference is location on the Earth.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-1-2	482	Since the Earth is on an axis, the Sun hits in right in the middle.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-1-2	483	This is the equator.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-2-50	484.1	Most skin cancer happens here because the sun is always shining in these parts more.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-1-2	484.2	Most skin cancer happens here because the sun is always shining in these parts more.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	O	485	Another difference in the irsk of developing skin cancer is protection.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-2-5	486.1	If you don't protect yourself from the sun, you'll get sunburn.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-5-4	486.2	If you don't protect yourself from the sun, you'll get sunburn.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-5-4	487	This damages the skin cells so they have to be replaced.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-6-50	488	Sometimes they can't be replaced so you can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-5-50	489	Also if you are sunburned more often you have a higher risk.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	R-1-50	490	The further you are from the equator the equator the less chance you have.
EBA1415_SERS_13-14_SC_ES-05102	O	491	In conclusion you should protect yourself and you'll be safe, espeically in sunny areas.//

EBA1415_KYNS_3_SC_ES-5922_9	R-4-6	508	As in the article informed "Sun burn" informed that normally abnormal or damaged cells are cleared away and replaced with new cells, but this dosen't always happen.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_SC_ES-5922_9	R-5-6	509	If a sunburn is severe enough it becomes less likely that all damaged skin cells will be removed.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_SC_ES-5922_9	R-5-50	510	Also as I read in the article "Sunburn" it informed suffering just one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_SC_ES-5684_9	R-1-50	511.1	Reasons why people can have higher risks to develop skin cancer are the following, living closer to the equator, too much exposure to the sun and sunburns in the past.

EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	O	671	Something's that I have just learned about skin cancer is that first of all on our bodies the largest organs is our skin it protect us from alot of things.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	O	672	and when you have skin cancer you start to devolpe dark patchs and it would be caused by basal cell carcnoma.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	O	673	You really have to take care of your body/skin.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	O	674	Because there are numerous of skin disorders./
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	R-4-5	675	I also learned about sunburn, sunburn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in the skin cell.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	R-5-6	676	"Sunburn happens when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells".
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	R-5-6	677.1	Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer they can be cleared away and be placed with new cells but that dosen't always happen, because some sunburns can be that severe that it becomes less likely that theirs nothing you can do about it.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	R-6-50	677.2	Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer they can be cleared away and be placed with new cells but that dosen't always happen, because some sunburns can be that severe that it becomes less likely that theirs nothing you can do about it.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	O	678	One researcjh investigat damged skin cells is critical.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-05465	O	679	So the main thing is that you should alwas try to protect/and take care of your skin the best way you can.//
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	R-5-50	680	Sun burn is an damage to the genetic molecules in the cells and sun burn can cause more problems such as death, skin cancer, or poisoning.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	R-5-6	681	Because sun burns are so server that they can happen at any age and it can less likely that all damaged skin cells would be removed.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	R-5-50	682	And it also says "Suffering just one serious childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of devolping skin cancer later in life".
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	R-4-5	683	And skin damage is critical more damage to the genetic molecules that leads to more severe sunburn damage.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	O	684	And skin cancer is one of the most feared because someone is at risk of having or developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	O	685	And the only way you'll know if you have skin cancer you'll start to develope dark patches on your body.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	O	686	And also there are three main skin cancers.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	O	687	One basal cell carcinoma; secondly, squamous cell carcinoma; thirdly, malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	O	688	And together those types of skin cancer can make up approximately 95 percent of skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06165	O	689	And the deadly skin cancer is an malignant melanoma is responsible for death.//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	O	690	Skin cancer can be really deadly.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	O	691	And there are 3 types of skin cancer basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	R-5-50	692	The people that live closer to the the equator have to be aware of the damage of the sun cause the sunburn could cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	R-5-6	693	Severe sunburn is called sunpoisoning and I could lead to infection and shock.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	R-5-6	694.1	In extreme cases it can even cause death if the sunburned skin cells aren't removed it can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	R-6-50	694.2	In extreme cases it can even cause death if the sunburned skin cells aren't removed it can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	R-5-50	695	If you suffered serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence it doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05171	R-11-12	696	Melanin is a special pigment produced in the epidermis.

EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	699	These are some of the reasons or problems that cause skin cancer./
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	700	To start, there are 3 main varieties of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	701	They're called basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	702	malignant melanoma is responsible for the most deaths of skin cancer./
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	703	The skin is the body's largest organ.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	704	It protects your body from extreme temperatures, chemicals, ink from pen, etc.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	705	There are three layers of skin.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	706	They are called the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	707	Epidermis produces something call melanin.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	708	When you don't have a lot to it, it makes it easer to make vitamin D.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_SC_ES-05697	O	709	NOT ENOUGH TIME//
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-1-4	710	The closer you live to the equator the more likely to have skin damage.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-4-50	711	The more skin damage you have the more likely it is to have skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	O	712	You may wonder and plonder at how this true.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	O	713	Skin cancer is the uncontroleld growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-2-50	714	When you sun tan you are at an even higher risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-2-5	715.1	When you tan your burning skin cells if the skin cells aren't removed they result in skin cancer.

EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	O	716	Even if your body knows to clear away the damaged cells, it may not always do so, though.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	O	717	Sunscreen can protect you a little bit.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-11-12	718	Your epidermis, the outer most part of skin, produces melanin, and it protects us from harmful chemicals.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-11-50	719	Albino people are at the most risk because this body doesn't product melanin as much.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	O	720	Going outdoors isn't dangerous it just that you want to be sure that you put sun screen on and be under some shade  at least 75% of the time.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	R-1-2	721	The farther away from the equator you are the less direct sunlight will hit you.

EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04998	O	723	Didn't get to finish
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	724	There are a couple of ways that someone can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	725	Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	726	Some might be asking themselves "What is skin cancer?" or "What types of skin cancer exists?"
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	727	Well, there are many questions, but there are also many answers. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	728	A common question is "What is skin cancer?"
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	729	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	730	There are 3 main varieties of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	731	These three are called: Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	732	The basal and squamos cell carcinoma make up approximately 95% of skin cancers.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	733	Malignant melanoma only occurs in about 5% ot skin cancer cases.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	734	However, Malignant Melanoma is responsible for most deaths from skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC-06281	O	735	Ran out of time. I had so much more to write. //
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06078	R-2-50	736	Skin cancer come from the sun somtime, like if you the sun for to long.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06078	O	737	When you get sunburn it is hurting your skin.//
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06078	O	738	Did not get done
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	O	739	Skin cancer is one of a number of different skin conditions and disorders, albeit one of the most dangerous and most tricky to surid(?).
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-5-50	740	A single severe sunburn when you are a child or a teen can seriously increase your chance of developing skin cancer later in your lifetime (Sunburn, June 2013).
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-2-4	741	The reason for this is that when skin becomes damaged by the sun, the damaged cells are replaced by new, healthy ones.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-5-6	742	However, as the severity of the sunburn increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult for all the skin cells to be completely replaced.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-2-4	743	But how, you may ask why would the sun damage your cells?
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	O	744	Is not the sun good for you?
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-2-4	745	Yes, while a brief stroll out in sunny weather can boost your phydsical and emotional health, but prolonged exposure to the sun can cause cellular damaged in what is known as sunburn.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-3-4	746.1	The reason that the sun burns you, and there fore damages your cells is because the sun gives off UVb rays, which is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-2-3	746.2	The reason that the sun burns you, and there fore damages your cells is because the sun gives off UVb rays, which is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-11-12	747.1	However, there is a natural protection to Uvb radiation, and it is a skin pigment called Melanin.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-12-3	747.2	However, there is a natural protection to Uvb radiation, and it is a skin pigment called Melanin.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	O	748	Melanin is a dark pigment, which is found more in people of darker colors, which is why paler people are at a slightly higher risk of skin cancer and usually sun burn more easily than prople of darker colors, such as African Americans.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-2-50	749.1	Speaking of people at higher risk for skin cancer, there are many more risk factors, such as location is to the equator, the more direct sunlight that place will received.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-1-2	749.2	Speaking of people at higher risk for skin cancer, there are many more risk factors, such as location is to the equator, the more direct sunlight that place will received.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-2-50	750	More sun is tantamount to higher risk of skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-1-50	751	Therefore, a person living in the southern tip of Florida is more likely to get skin cancer than someone living in Northern Canada.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	O	752	Of course, there are many other factors that can put a person at risk for skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWMD_4-5_SC_ES-04994	R-3-50	753	Tanning beds, for example, give off extreme amounts of UVb rays and put a person who tans with at a greater risk for skin cancer.//
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	O	754	The skin protects our inner tissue from infection and loss of water as well as regulating our body temperature.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	O	755	It is composed of three layers; epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	O	756	When any or all of these layers are affected in a negative way, numerous skin disorders, conditions, and diseases occur.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	O	757	Skin cancer, which is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells, is the most feared since everyone is at a risk of it whether the risk is low or high.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	O	758	Skin cancer (the main three are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma) could be caused by multiple factors.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-3-4	759	Solar radiation such as UVb radiation causes damage to genetic molecules in skin cells after excessive exposure.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-3-5	760.1	These Uvb rays may cause sunburn, and skin cancer can arise when sunburned skin cells are not removed.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-6-50	760.2	These Uvb rays may cause sunburn, and skin cancer can arise when sunburned skin cells are not removed.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-5-6	760.3	These Uvb rays may cause sunburn, and skin cancer can arise when sunburned skin cells are not removed.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-5-50	761	Just one serious sunburn during adolescence doubles the chances of skin cancer developing later in life.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-1-3	762	The location of where you live also determines how much Uvb radiation you are exposed to.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-1-2	763.1	The closer you are to the equator (0 degrees latitude) the more direct sunlight there is year round, which means skin cancer has a higher chance of developing./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-2-50	763.2	The closer you are to the equator (0 degrees latitude) the more direct sunlight there is year round, which means skin cancer has a higher chance of developing./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-12-3	764	The skin is critical in providing a healthy life due to it protecting the body from extreme temperatures, damaging solar radiation, chemicals, infection, and manufacturing vitamin D.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05530	R-3-50	765	When skin cancer is developed due to excessive Uvb radiation, it is a serious problem that needs to be addressed quickly.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	O	766	The article given stated that skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-2-50	767	The main cause of skin cancer is the sun. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-3-50	768	To be presice, Uvb radiation is what results in skin cancer. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-2-3	769	The sun produces Uvb radiation, and the more sun there is, the more Uvb radiation there is also.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-1-2	770	The closer someone is to the equator, the more direct sunlight there is that hits the earth.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-1-50	771	Most people living near the equator have developed skin cancer. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-12-3	772	Normally, the skin protects the body against extreme temperatures, solar radiation, and chemicals. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	O	773	The skin produces Vitamin D for converting calcium into healthy bones. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-12-3	774	Even though our skin protects us against solar radiation, it can't protect us against Uvb. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-3-4	775	The rays of Uvb damage genetic molecules in the skin cells. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-11-12	776	Melanin is a pigment produced in the epidermis in the skin. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-11-12	777.1	It helps to protect us from solar radiation. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-12-3	777.2	It helps to protect us from solar radiation. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	O	778	But having less Melamin means it's easier for our body to make vitamin D. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-11-3	779	The downside to this is with less Melanin, it's easyer for Uvb radiation to get into our bodies.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-5-6	780	Getting sun burn is when the body directs blodd to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-5-50	781	Having sunburn can rise your chances of getting skin cancer, and can also be fatal. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-1-50	782.1	Going back to the begining of this responce, skin cancer can be caused by the Sun's rays and Uvb radiation. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-2-50	782.2	Going back to the begining of this responce, skin cancer can be caused by the Sun's rays and Uvb radiation. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-3-50	782.3	Going back to the begining of this responce, skin cancer can be caused by the Sun's rays and Uvb radiation. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-1-50	783	It can all depend on where you live on the earth.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04854	R-2-50	784	But you can still get skin cancer where ever thre is sun or high Uvb radiation. //
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	O	785	Skin cancer is today the most common for of skin cancer in the U.S.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-5-50	786.2	Many things can cause skin cancer, two off them are uvb radiation and sunburn./
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	O	787	To start off, uvb radiation is basically direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-1-50	788	In geography, there is a latitude and longitude, and depending on where you are latitude wise, you have a higher risk of receiving skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-3-50	789.1	Most people who receive skin cancer because of uvb radaition live in the tropic of cancer (23N) and capricorn (23S) where the sun shines directly on to the earth.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-2-3	789.2	Most people who receive skin cancer because of uvb radaition live in the tropic of cancer (23N) and capricorn (23S) where the sun shines directly on to the earth.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-1-2	790	Because of this people in the tropic zone and areas close by have to be careful./
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-5-50	791	Another thing that can cause skin cancer is sunburn.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	O	792	Most people have had sunburn; the red skin, the annoying painful burning sensation, well too much will cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-5-6	793.1	When one is sunburned, the skin cells in that area are destroyed and the body sends blood cells to repair it.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-5-4	793.2	When one is sunburned, the skin cells in that area are destroyed and the body sends blood cells to repair it.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-6-50	794	If not all destroyed cells are removed, they cannot duplicate and cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	R-5-50	795	The chances of that happening are slim as a child but if one gets a serious burn as a child, the can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-04742	O	796	So always wear sunblock when you are going to be outside in the summer.//
EBA1415_RDCS_1_SC_ES-04697	R-3-50	797.1	In this passage their are many different ways on developing skin cancer, sun poisoning, skin that has severe sun burn, uvb radiation.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_SC_ES-04697	R-5-50	797.2	In this passage their are many different ways on developing skin cancer, sun poisoning, skin that has severe sun burn, uvb radiation.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_SC_ES-04697	R-12-3	798	But since the skin does protect us it has some defences from things like uvb radiatino like melanin.

EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-2-5	923	Lets start with the basics: If you are out in the Sun too long, you can get sunburned.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	O	924	This is rather frequent, and perhaps healthy sicne you generate new skin cells too take over the old ones.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-5-50	925	But a SERIOUS sunburn can lead to an increased risk in skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-5-50	926	As the text states "suffering just one serious sunburn as a child or adolescent can double the chances of developing skin cancer later in life."
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-5-50	927	These chances also double if a person has fine or more sunburns at any age./
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-2-50	928	Now the longer you are in the sun, the more likely you are to gain a risk of having skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	O	929	That means Latitude matters.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-1-2	930.1	In fact, if you are anywhere between the Tropics of Cancer (23oN) and Capricorn(23oS) you are exposed longest to sunshine, so cell damage is more frequent.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-2-4	930.2	In fact, if you are anywhere between the Tropics of Cancer (23oN) and Capricorn(23oS) you are exposed longest to sunshine, so cell damage is more frequent.

EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-4-6	931	This can lead to an overall depleation of cells, and a halt in any regeneration of cells, which now leaves you, as a human being, vulnerable to the U.V. rays that cause the unusual growth of abnormal cells.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	O	932	The three classisifications are basal cell carcinoma (most frequent) squamous cell carcinoma (also frequent) and malignant melanoma (rare but deadly)/
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05941	R-2-50	933	In conclusion, there are multiple variables that lead to a risk in skin cancer, but the main one is the sun.//
EBA1415_LVSN_7_SC_ES-05910	R-5-50	934	What leads to the differences in the risk of developing skin cancer is, a bad sunburn, a dark patch to the right of the persons eye, is caused by a basal cell carcinoma.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_SC_ES-05910	O	935	There are numerous skin disorders, conditions, and disease./

EBA1415_LVSN_7_SC_ES-05772	R-2-50	937	You can get skin cancer by having direct sunlight.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_SC_ES-05772	R-1-2	938	For example people closer to the equator have more risks w/sun exposure.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_SC_ES-05772	R-1-50	939.1	If you live farther away from the equator you have less risks.

EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-5801_9	O	943	The type of skin cancer one gets depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-5801_9	R-1-50	944	Another way one can get skin cancer is the location in where you live.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-5801_9	R-1-2	945.1	For example, if you live in a really hot place where you get direct sunlight then you have a higher chance of developing skin cancer, rather than if you lived in another place.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-5801_9	R-2-50	945.2	For example, if you live in a really hot place where you get direct sunlight then you have a higher chance of developing skin cancer, rather than if you lived in another place.

EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-5801_9	R-2-3	946	The reason is because the sunlight you receive centering UVb radiation which is harmful to the skin.//
EBA1415_BGJD_2_SC_ES-05747	R-5-50	947	Early detection of skin cancer uvb radiation and sunburn leads to risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_SC_ES-05747	O	948	Three main skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_SC_ES-05747	O	949	Together basal and squamous cell carcinomas make up approximately 95 precent of skin cancers.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_SC_ES-05747	O	950	Malignant melanoma only occurs in approximately 5 percent of skin cancer cases.

EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	O	952	There are a lot of different things that can lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	O	953	Uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells is a major way.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	O	954	Skin cancer develops on skin cells that produce irregularly.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-3-50	955	If you are exposed to a lot of uvb radiation then you are more likely to get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-1-3	956.1	Usually, people with the most uvb radiation live near the equator, but on the 2nd sheet it explains that risks of sun exposure are everywhere.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-1-2	956.2	Usually, people with the most uvb radiation live near the equator, but on the 2nd sheet it explains that risks of sun exposure are everywhere.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-1-2	957.1	If there is more sunlight in the area, there is more uvb radiation.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-2-3	957.2	If there is more sunlight in the area, there is more uvb radiation.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-5-50	958	That's why when people are severely sunburned, they are most likely to develop skin cancer later on in life.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-5-6	959	This is because when sunburns are so terrible and severe, some of the sunburned skin cells aren't removed.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-6-50	960	When they aren't removed, it could very easily result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	O	961	Some parts of our bodies protect us from skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-04805	R-11-12	962.1	Melanin, the pigment of our skin, protects us from solar radiation.

EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	O	978	Because of this, our skin is exposed to just about everything, including heat or UVb radiation.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	O	979	Skin disorders come as a result from mistreatment to the skin, and there are 3 types of skin cancer which are: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	O	980	For some or most people, an unusual dark patch on their skin can be a cause of basal cell carcinoma.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	O	981	Since our skin is open or exposed to alot of things one of the most dangerous is direct sunlight.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	R-1-2	982	Depending on the area in which you live in, you can be getting dangerous amounts of sunlight consistently.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	O	983	This is for people who live closer to the equator, and even people who don't live as close need to be concerned and aware of any sun exposure.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	R-2-3	984.1	This direct sunlight or sun exposure is what leads to UVb radiation, another factor in developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05018	R-3-50	984.2	This direct sunlight or sun exposure is what leads to UVb radiation, another factor in developing skin cancer.

EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1054	So after what I have been or started reading a lot of people have died due to skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1055	I never knew some of the parts of our skin.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1056	I learned your skin can turn completely red in the sun.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1057	At first, (before I read this article) I thought it was just a light red, but actually its a dark.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1058	I never, in my life, knew that sun burns can turn into sun poisoning and kill it.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1059	That was very ineresting to learn about.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1060	Something I read and knew about already was that your skin protects you from infections and loss of water in your body.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1061	Last thing for Sun burns is that I believed that sun burns are just processes that happens regularly to the human in the sun.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1062	I'm gald I learned that this something pretty serious.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1063	But I have one question, does it cause skin cancer?
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1064	When I first saw the article dealing with latitude and longitude, I was wondering, why was this in here and has nothing to do with science.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1065	I knew most of the stuff that was on there already.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1066	But I saw something new and kind of interesting to me.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	R-1-2	1067	That would be the closer you are to the equator, the more consistent direct sunlight will be.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1068	Which means people closer to the equator needs to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1069	So back to the subject on skin.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	R-3-50	1070	I will be telling ways you can probably get skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1071	I believe one is by getting an open cut so infections could probably get into your skin.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1072	Even though your skin maybe very protectful, it can't completely protect you from everything.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	R-3-50	1073	One example is a UVb radiation can get into your body and cause an infection.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1074	Your body must be able to fight it.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1075	The three types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1076	The last one I said is responsible for the most death's from skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05065	O	1077	I hope there's a cure for it.//

EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-1-50	1103	There are many factors that lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-1-50	1104	It depends on where you live, what you are exposed to etc.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-1-2	1105.1	In the latitude article, it talks about how if people live near the equator, they are more likely to experience skin cancer because they happen to be exposed to the sun more.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-2-50	1105.2	In the latitude article, it talks about how if people live near the equator, they are more likely to experience skin cancer because they happen to be exposed to the sun more.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-1-50	1106	Even if you don't live near the equator, there is still a chance that you could get it.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	O	1107	In the skin protects you article, it talks about how skin cancer is one of the biggest concerns in the U.S.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	O	1108	This is because in the U.S. the body is exposed UVb radiation.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-3-6	1109	Most of the time if the body is exposed to UVb radiation, it would repair itself however if it is very severe you would have to get the abnormal cells removed.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-3-50	1110	UVb radiation is a big factor on the causes of skin cancer..
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-5-6	1111	In the sunburn article, it talks about how if you have had a sunburn more than once in your childhood, the body would have a harder time with repairing the skin because of how damaged the skin cells already are.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-4-5	1112.1	In the text it also states that "the amount of damaged genetic molecules can be used as an indicator of sunburn severity."
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-2-5	1112.2	In the text it also states that "the amount of damaged genetic molecules can be used as an indicator of sunburn severity."
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-2-5	1113	So the severity depends on how badly you were exposed to the sun and on how much you got a sunburn.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	R-6-50	1114	If you don't remove the badly infected skin cells, it would most likely lead to cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC-5939	O	1115	In conclusion there are many factors that could lead to skin cancer and it all depends on your location and how badly you were exposed to something.//
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04681	O	1116	Skin is our bodies largest organ and it helps protect our body from any dangerous or harmful exposure.

EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04681	R-1-2	1118	The amount of direct sunlgiht depends on the location and the closer you are to the equator the more light you will actually get.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04681	O	1119	This means that direct sunlight can be really harmful.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04681	O	1120	This is important because our skin can't completely protect us from harmful exposure and other different infections that our bodies can contract.//

EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05822	O	1183	If you get a little sunburned you damaged or killed skin cells.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05822	O	1184	This can cause abnormal cells.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05822	R-2-4	1185.1	The sun can destroy the cells but the more severe the sunburn the harder it is for the body to destroy all the ??? (damaged) cells.

EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05822	R-6-50	1186	This gives you a very high chance of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05822	R-5-50	1187	Another factor that increases you chance of developing skin cancer is if you suffer multiple sunburns expesially as a child.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05822	O	1188	A way to greatly reduce the risk of developing skin cancer is using proper protection such as sunscreen and to limit the amount of exposere you have.//
EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	O	1189	In my opinion, I think skin cancer is develop with stages of cancer & shows how bad your cancer is or could get./
EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	O	1190	First of all in the text it states "There are 3 types of cancer in this human world which are basal cell carcinoma, squamous melanoma".
EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	O	1191	This means that they know which ones are more deadly & it shows that Basal & squamous make up 95% of skin cancer, but is not that deadly.
EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	O	1192	Wich the other type of cancer.
EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	O	1193	Malignant causes 5% of cancer but is one of the most deadlyest type you could get./
EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	R-11-12	1194	Secondly, in the text it states "The advantages of having less melanin is that it is easier for the body to make vitamin D.

EBA1415_LVSNa_1_SC_ES-05998	R-3-50	1196	This is important because once our UVb radiation is a bit damage you can go to a big risk of skin cancer.//
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05013	O	1197	What could lead to skin cancer is the cells produce irregularly.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05013	O	1198	Also when the cells produce irregularly you get an uncontrollable gtrowth of abnormal cells.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05013	O	1199	You could get it by having too much of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05013	R-2-5	1200.1	So the effects of having too much sunlight you could get sunburn which could lead to skin cancer.

EBA1415_RHSGa_2_SC_ES-05074	R-6-50	1219	Sometimes the cells are replaced but if not then skin cancer happens./
EBA1415_RHSGa_2_SC_ES-05074	O	1220	I believe when skin cells produce irregularly then skin cancer occurs.
EBA1415_RHSGa_2_SC_ES-05074	O	1221	The cells mutate and either does something good or something bad and in this case its bad.
EBA1415_RHSGa_2_SC_ES-05074	O	1222	Your skin has three layers and when 1 layer is injured then skill cells rebuild that layer.

EBA1415_TRKM_2_SC-06049	R-5-50	1452	Sunburn is also a way to develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_SC-06049	R-4-5	1453	Sunburn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_SC-06049	R-5-6	1454	Sunburn happens when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_SC-06049	O	1455	Normally, abnormal or damaged cells are cleared away & replaced with new cells, but this doesn't always happen.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_SC-06049	R-5-4	1456	If the sunburn is severe enough, it will damage skin cells.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_SC-06049	R-5-50	1457	Also, suffering just one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life. //
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC_ES-04728	O	1458	There are numerous skin disorders, conditions, and diseases.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC_ES-04728	O	1459	Of these, skin cancer is among the most feared because everyone is at some risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC_ES-04728	O	1460	but some people are at a higher risk than others.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC_ES-04728	O	1461	Additionally, skin cancer, is the most common form of cancer in the uncontrolled growth of cancer in the USA.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC_ES-04728	O	1462	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_SC_ES-04728	O	1463	The variety of skin cell that develops depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces irregularly./

EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-1-2	1468	The closer someone is to the equator (0 degrees) the more consistent the direct sunlight will be.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-1-2	1469	Some locations have moderate to extreme levels of direct sunlight yearround.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	O	1470	These locations include the Northern third of Australia and the Southern parts of the United States.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-2-3	1471	In general, the more direct sunlight there is, the more Uvb radiation there is.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-5-50	1480.1	This is because sunburns are produced by the damage to genetic molecules in skin cells from the sun.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-4-5	1480.2	This is because sunburns are produced by the damage to genetic molecules in skin cells from the sun.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-5-6	1481	The more severe the burn is, the more chance someone has to develop sun poisening.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-5-6	1482.1	If this happens, it becomes less likely for all of the damaged cells to be recovered/removed.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05531	R-6-50	1482.2	If this happens, it becomes less likely for all of the damaged cells to be recovered/removed.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-4-6	1485	When a skin cell's genetic material is damaged, one of three things happen.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-4-6	1486	The body can heal itself, either by a) repairing the cell or b), if it would be easier to just replace the cell, sweep the damaged cell away in the blood stream and grow a fresh cell there.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	O	1487	The differences come in when one considers how many cells were damaged and how badly.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	O	1488	The third thing that can happen is if there are too many severly damaged skin cells, the blood stream cannot take all of them fast enough.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-4-6	1489.1	A cell that has damaged genetic code and is left unaided may become cancerous.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-6-50	1489.2	A cell that has damaged genetic code and is left unaided may become cancerous.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-5-50	1490	On the 5th document titled Sunburn. the previous information  is backed up along with an interesting statement regarding if an adolescent or child suffers a severe sunburn, the likelyhood of skin cancer later in life, if the child does not already have it, is doubled.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-5-50	1491	This would lead to differences in the risk of skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-5-50	1492	Sun burn in general raises the risk.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05515	R-1-50	1493	Therefore, as the graph document shows, living near the equator gives a higher trend ratio of skin cancer patients to citizens.//

EBA1415_TRJA_11_SC_ES-05708	O	1572	That's why the skin prevents infection in skin from the sun.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_SC_ES-05708	R-3-4	1573	Uvb is a type of radiation that can cause small amounts of damage to the skin.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_SC_ES-05708	R-11-12	1574.1	Melanin protects from the sun even though it would not typically help with the cause of sunburn.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_SC_ES-05708	R-12-2	1574.2	Melanin protects from the sun even though it would not typically help with the cause of sunburn.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_SC_ES-05708	R-5-4	1575	When sunburn occur it damage the genetic molecules, to turn the blood red on to the skin.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_SC_ES-05708	O	1576	That is what orginally happens.//
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	O	1577	Differences that lead to a risk of developing skin cancer aren't very difficult to grasp.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-1-2	1578	A few examples are your location on earth, and how hard the sun hits that specific location.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-2-50	1579	UVb radiation exposure ties into that as well, even your time out in the sun could influence your chances of developing skin cancer./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	O	1580	In the documents there were various references to location.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-1-2	1581.1	",the closer you are to the equator, the more consistent direct sunlight the higher the chances of getting skin cancer./

EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	O	1582	It all goes back to UvB radiation- The skin cells can onyl fix some damages, if it's a consistent occurence it can produce a problem for us.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	O	1583	Although some may live in places where direct sunlight isn't a year round occurence it still presents a problem, just seasonal.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-1-50	1584	The graph shows decline in skin cancer as latitude distance from the equator increases- but it doesn't eliminate all cases.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-1-50	1585	Therefore South American countries are more at risk than the U.S. or Northern countries./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-2-3	1586	Even tanning or going out in the sun can produce UvB radiation.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-5-6	1587.1	When you get a sunburn molecules in your sun go and fix the damaged cells- it could be simple if it's a mild burn, however if its a severe burn, chances are some cells will not be fixed- leaving amounts of radiation in yuor skin- just one bad case of sunburn can double your chances of getting skin cancer./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05324	R-5-50	1587.2	When you get a sunburn molecules in your sun go and fix the damaged cells- it could be simple if it's a mild burn, however if its a severe burn, chances are some cells will not be fixed- leaving amounts of radiation in yuor skin- just one bad case of sunburn can double your chances of getting skin cancer./

EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-06283	O	1589	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-06283	O	1590	Which skin cancer is developed depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces irregularly.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-06283	O	1591	There are three variaties of skin cancer; basal cell caricnoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-06283	O	1592	If you are closer to the equator you need to be more aware about the dangers from sunlight.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-06283	R-5-6	1596	If sunburn is severe enough it becomes less likely that all damaged skin cells will be removed.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_SC_ES-06283	R-5-50	1597	Chances for skin cancer doubles if you had serious sunburn in childhood or if a person has five or more sunburns at any age.//

EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1600	My paper was about skin damage and you may not know that the skin is the largest organ on the human body.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1601	The skin covers every region of the body.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1602	Our skin helps us regulate our body tempature.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1603	But some of us may take something for granted such as our skin and thats something that helps us out very much without the skin our body would loose most of its water and you could have a good chance of infection in the body.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1604	The human body is like a open cut or a open lasceraction on the body which can get infected.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1605	Severe sunburn is one good example of infection, not all people with sunburn get the infection right off the back.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	R-5-50	1606	It depends on how bad your sunburn really is (for example (if the sunburn is severely brused and peeled skin and really red its a chance you could have the infection.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1607	The ifection doesn't always come tho.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05462	O	1608	It all depends on how bad the burn is.

EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_SC_ES-04915	O	1612	There are a many ways to develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_SC_ES-04915	R-2-50	1613	You can develop skin cancer by not keeping your skin clean, or even playing in the hot radiant sun for to long.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_SC_ES-04915	O	1614	If you don't stay outside for longer than six hours a day you should be fine.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_SC_ES-04915	R-2-50	1615	I believe you shouldn't be outside until it starts cooling down.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_SC_ES-04915	R-2-50	1616	By doing this not only will you have a lower chance of overheating or getting too hot but you will also have a lower chance of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_SC_ES-04915	O	1617	If you check your body and see anything unusual it is best that you contact you doctor immediately because you could be showing early signs of skin cancer.

EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05447	R-5-6	1831	When sunburn happens, blood gets directed from your body to the sunburnt skin to try and repair it.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05447	O	1832	The damaged cells will get replaced with healthy ones.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05447	O	1833	When sunburn is red, it is the blood flow trying to repair the skin.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05447	O	1834	If you have severe enough sunburn, it is called sun poising, which can lead to infection, shock, or even death.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_SC_ES-05447	R-5-6	1835	So, if you have severe sunburn that does not heal, you will have many dead skin cells which is not healthy.
