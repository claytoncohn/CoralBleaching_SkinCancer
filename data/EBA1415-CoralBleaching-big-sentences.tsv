EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05670	R-7-50	111	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is for example in background: What is "coral bleaching"? it says "The different types of algae living withing the coral polyps give the corals their varying colors."
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05670	R-7-50	112	This meaning that this might as well cause the bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05670	O	113	We say a severe amount of coral bleaching in 1998.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05670	O	114	Coral bleaching can be cause by the change in environment which affects the relationship between the coral and its food as stated in the 3rd paragraph in the article "coral and zooxanthellae".
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05670	R-7-50	115	The corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae this bleaching makes the coral vulnerable to alot of disease and starvation most of the coral reef do not recover and die. //
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05411	O	116	Coral bleaching is a big deal in todays world, it can cause death to many if the world's coral.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05411	O	117	It occurs when the relationship between coral zooxanthellae is negatively impacted, which causes the zooxanthellae to leave the coral or die.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05411	R-7-50	118	Since zooxanthellae is the reason coral has it's amazing colors, when zooxanthellae leaves the coral, the coral turns white and can even die.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05411	O	119	According to "coral and zooxanthealle", "a massive coral bleaching event in 1998 is considered one of the worst ever observed.

EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	R-1-3	130	But sometimes they alter causing the wind trade to weaken or reverse.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	R-1-3	131	When that occurs, it cause the sea level to change and the water temperature to change.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	132	The water increase by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F and even 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	R-3-50	133	This change in temperature changes the balanced temperature in the coral reef, therefore causing coral bleaching to start. /
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	134	Another thing that causes coral bleaching is photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	135	Even though coral is made up of really tiny animals, photosynthesis affects them.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	136	It affects it through zooxanthellae, because it uses the energy from the sunlight to combine carbon dioxide in the ocean water.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	137	If there is a amounal balance, ther sugar it produced.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	138	If the carbon level is low the if would be different for the coral, because it get 50% to 95% of its energy from this process. /

EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	140	The ocean winds, photosynthesis and zooxanthellae are just some of the tings that can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05765	O	141	A lot of life depends on coral reefs, sea too are affected when coral reefs are balanced. //
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06160	O	142	Coral bleaching can happen when it is in the Atlantic ocean.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06160	O	143	Also it can be found in areas between 70-85oF.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06160	O	144	I think coral bleaching happens because of the color eroding away from being in water so long.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06160	O	145	Another theory is just it being dead polyp all over it.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06160	O	146	When the polyp is alive it has color, but after its dead maybe it loses color.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	R-7-50	147	Coral bleaching is when coral's symbiotic partner zooxanthallae is killed off.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	O	148	When the zooxanthallae is killed off coral becomes weak and prone to death, while some recover, most do not.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	O	151	When coral is damaged it can not produce the nutrients that the algae needs to live.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	R-5B-50	152	This means that the algae does not pass on the food it makes to the coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	R-5B-50	153	Thus giving the coral nothing to eat and it dies. /

EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	R-1-50	157	Another reason for Coral bleaching is tradewinds.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	O	158	normally this does not make a difference, but every few years the trade shift.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	R-1-3	159	When the temperature of the water changes in accordance to the trade winds.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04736	O	160	The coral needs temperature of 70-85 degrees F in order to reproduce.

EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05200	O	337	There are many reasons why coral bleaching happenes, but they all refer to trade winds causing the lose of corals.//
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	O	338	First coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which corals loses its color.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	R-11-50	339	I think that what leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is how much storms the tropical places have.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	R-11-12	340.1	According to the 4th paper "Coral and photosynthesis," it says that whenever there is a storm it releases fresh water which goes into the oceans or tropical lakes and this makes the salt in the water to decrease and the corals need a certain balance in order for it to be healthy.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	R-12-13	340.2	According to the 4th paper "Coral and photosynthesis," it says that whenever there is a storm it releases fresh water which goes into the oceans or tropical lakes and this makes the salt in the water to decrease and the corals need a certain balance in order for it to be healthy.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	R-13-14	341.1	When the salt in the lake drops it makes an unbalance which affects the coral's health.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	R-14-50	341.2	When the salt in the lake drops it makes an unbalance which affects the coral's health.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5852	R-14-50	342	This also makes the color of the coral to be removed in order words (bleached).//
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	O	343	There are lots of things that cause the corals to lose their color and become unhealthy.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	O	344	Pysically destructive practices such as blast fishing, anchors being dropped or tourists walking on the reefs.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-1-3	345	But the best explanation on what leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the very critical environmental changes the corals endure such as trade winds which cause increases in water temperature.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-1-2	346	These environmental changes occur when trade winds shift from west to east.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-1-2	347	This movement according to the text drags warm surface waters eastward toward South America.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	O	348	This movement then causes the central and eastern pacific regions to swell.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	O	349	Then as the warm surface water continues to flow eastward it causes major shifts in the worlds climates.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-3-5	350	So the coral reefs are effected by this because according to the text they need temperatures between 70-85 degrees F so that the sensative process of photosynthesis can still occur.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-3-4	351	When the climate changes occur, the water temperature increases and when water temperature increases the amount of CO2 which is needed to keep the corals healthy decreases.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-4-5	352.1	The balance of H2O and CO2 is shaken and photosynthesis does not occur causing the corals to eject the algae that provides them food and their colors.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-5-7	352.2	The balance of H2O and CO2 is shaken and photosynthesis does not occur causing the corals to eject the algae that provides them food and their colors.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-7-50	352.3	The balance of H2O and CO2 is shaken and photosynthesis does not occur causing the corals to eject the algae that provides them food and their colors.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-7-50	353	This causes bleaching and makes the corals vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6048	R-1-3	354.1	In conclusion the things that lead to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching are environmental changes such as trade winds which cause changes in water temperature that are not good for the corals, resulting in coral bleaching and possibly disease or starvation.//

EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05149	O	358	So the eastern part of the Pacific waters become hotter that those in the western pacific.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05149	O	359	The sea levels even rise in central and eastern pacific.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05149	R-2-3	360	normal water temperature are 70-80 degrees F in the region but when the surface waters shift eastward ocean water temp increase by 3 degrees to 10 degrees F.

EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	700	Many corals have been bleached, a plain white.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	701	I read that a coral polyp has a sacklike body and a mouth surrounded by stinging tentalles.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	702	Also, they range in size and polyps use limestone from seawaters to build  a hard skeleton.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	R-7-50	703	Coral bleaching is an example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthallae and with that corals turn white due to their ejection/death.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	704	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it's colors.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	705	I read about the trade winds and how they move.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	706	They move east to west.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	707	About phenomenon, I read that it is known as upwelling.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	708	Trade winds also weaken and reverse direction.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05302	O	709	Today, I learned about coral bleaching and what occurs and did not know that corals are different colors and then turn white.//
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	O	710	this background article is about coral reefs and "Coral bleeching?"
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	O	711	Coral bleaching has an impact on coral reefs and how they function.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	O	712	Some coral reef need a certain amount of salinity so they can function correctly.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	O	713	Salinity is how salty the water is.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	R-3-5	714	They also need temperature from 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change of water.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	O	715	I believe that it is hard to get the process of coral bleaching because of the certain ways they have to get things done.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05832	O	716	Corals are all over the world, of course they have to be in salt water, but if you look everywhere in salt water they are always ther, in different corals and sometimes shape, coral is mistaken for rock or plant, but actually is made up of tiny animals called polyps.

EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05011	R-2-3	721	I say this because in the text it stats "Normal water temperature in those regions is 70-80oF, However, when surface water shift eastward, ocean water temperatures increase by 3oF to 5oF,".
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05011	O	722	I think this has something to do with coral bleaching because this is found in the ocean.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05011	O	723	The wind and water temperature may tell us how big the problem is.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05011	O	724	Also I think zooxanthellae is anther part of coral bleaching because the text stats "Coral and zooxanthellae algae have a symbiotic relationship."

EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	O	748	This is where trade winds come into play.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	O	749	According to the article Shifting Trade Winds, "upwelling in the eastern Pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western Pacific.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	O	750	This movement of warm water eastward causes major shifts int he world's climate." 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	R-3-4	751	This warm water is also bad for the coral because as another article, Coral and Photosynthesis, stated that if the water temperature increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the water decreases. 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	O	752	This is bad because an algae zooxanthellae that live in the coral's tissue use the energy from the sunlight to combine carbon dioxide in the ocean with water, basically undergoing photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	O	753	As a result they get sugars and oxygen, the sugars produced are then passed to the coral.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04885	R-4-5B	754	But if there's less carbon dioxide than usual the algae won't be able to do this and it won't be good for the corals./

EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	916	Coral bleaching can be caused by many things, they all have to do with something that happens to the symbiotic relationship they have with the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	R-7-50	917	The reason for this is because of the fact that if something happens to the zooxanthellae that causes them to basically throw out the food they had, which the coral eat, then the coral starts to starving and looses its color.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	918	Since the zooxanthellae alos gives the coral its color.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	919	This leads to the "look" of coral bleaching which gives it it's name.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	920	In reality it has nothing to do with bleach like you'd think it would it's just nameed like that because of, again, the "look."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	921	The rates are kind of different/inconsistent every year.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	922	The highest report though was in 1998 for more than 70 reports.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	923	The reates aren't really specific, at least not to me, so I infer that the rates of coral bleaching happening are risning since in the text it clearly  states that coral bleaching happens because a disturbance in the environment caused the zooxanthellae to be ejected from the coral.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05414	O	924	With that being said we know how bad weather condtions invasive we're become when it comes to animals and their habitats.

EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05119	R-3-50	936	Secondly another way coral bleaching can occur is the change in temperature.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05119	R-3-5	937.1	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degree F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in temperature can affect the amount of bleach in coral after all.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-06002	R-5-50	986	Another thing that leads to the rate of coral bleaching is photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-06002	O	987	The algae that lives in the coral tissues, need light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-06002	O	988	The chemicals that the algea make provide the coral with the energy to survive.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-06002	R-12-13	989	If there are increasing amount of fresh water in the ocean, that causes the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-06002	R-13-14	990	The drop in salinity upsets the balance necessary for the coral health.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-06002	O	991	Since the algae provides the corals with their colors the changes in the environment can cause the algae to bleach. //
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-1-50	992	The reason why there was a difference in the rates of coral bleacing is because of the trade winds.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	O	993	Corals are usually found in clear shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	O	994	Zooxanthellae, live in the coral tissues and need sunlight for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	O	995	They also need carbon.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	O	996	The zooxanthellae and coral need these living conditions to survive, and if they were bothered with, this would be a disaster for the corals.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-11-13	997	Storms can threaten the ocean salinity, which is the level of salt.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	O	998	The zooxanthellae needs good environment to make food to provide food for itself and the coral.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-7-50	999	If it's not in a good environment, the coral, would have to eject the dead zooxantellae algae, and it would lose it's color.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	O	1000	Since their has been a suddetn icnrease, it changed the enviornment, making it a bad place for the coral and zooxanthellae to grow in.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-1-3	1001	The trade wind could've increased the temperature in the water.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-7-50	1002	Since the coral is so sensitive to change, it wasn't able to adopt to the temeprature change, thus, the zooxanthellae died, the coral ejected out the dead, algae and the coral turned white.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-1-50	1003.1	So in the end, the cause of coral bleaching was from trade winds because the coral couldn't had handle the change in temeprature caused by the trade winds, and had to eject the zooxanthellae, making it lose it's color. //
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05684	R-1-3	1003.2	So in the end, the cause of coral bleaching was from trade winds because the coral couldn't had handle the change in temeprature caused by the trade winds, and had to eject the zooxanthellae, making it lose it's color. //

EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1008	Their are a couple variation that can lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1009	To start off shifting trade winds is one of the reasons for differences in coral reefs.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1010	In the document it states that water were coral live shift towards different directions, either east to west or west to east.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1011	This affects the coral because the water temperatures are changing and it's not dead.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1012	Now as of the graphs when there was higher water tempearture but ? trade winds there were a severel number of reports for coral bleaching in 1998.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1013	Also to add on to that Algae is very important because it helps the coral.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1014	It gioves off glucose to coral and important chemicals.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1015	So if the Algae isn't in proper environment so that it can function properly than the coral it will effect the coral.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1016	Another reason would be if the relation ship between zooxanthellae algae and the coral breaks apart ? that the zooxanthellae dies.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05345	O	1017	To sum everything up if water temperatures change to a temperature that the coral reef and it's surroundings that help it function correctly can't sunstain, the coral will experience coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04859	R-7-50	1018	Coral bleaching happends when algie dies in the coral.
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04859	R-5B-7	1019	Alge dies when it is away from coral or when it doesn't get energy.
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04859	R-7-50	1020	When the algi dies the coral turn white because the algi give it the color.

EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05553	O	1038	The most dangerous threat is enviroment change.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05553	O	1039	When the water changes temps or when an anchor is dropped on then that's a drastic change.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05553	R-3-50	1040	In 1998 16% of the world's coral reefs died due to the water temp. changing.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05553	R-7-50	1041.1	The reason on why they turn white is because when stress is put on coral the enviroment forces coral to eject their food-producing algae.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04752	O	1051	What I think the biggest factor is us humans.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04752	O	1052	I say that because it states in one of the articles that we are bleaching them by walking on the reefs and dropping anchors on them.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04752	O	1053	Also, they bleach when their environment changes, I think this happens because their so used to being underwater and in a certain temperature zone.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04752	O	1054	So when they are removed the die instantly because they have never lived in another climate.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04752	O	1055	I think the reason the amounts of bleaching went up then down then, then down was because we had awareness for this then it stopped but then our technology got better so we found more bleached coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-04752	O	1056	Then, we got better technology.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04776	O	1074	There are many environmental causes to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04776	O	1075	The shift in Trade Winds can cause waters that are shallow in some areas to become flooded, due to the upwelling or warm waters in the areas.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04776	O	1076	Tropical waters may become cooler as well.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04776	R-1-50	1077	According to the charts from Reefbase.org, in 1998 when the wind trades were weak, the coral bleaching rose up to seven times the amount, severly. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04776	R-7-14	1078	Along with the shifting Trade Winds, the drop in zooxanthellae (algae in coral) can sometimes affect the coral's health.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04776	O	1079	Algae it takes in the coral's CO2 and produces glucose and O2.

EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1089	The different types of algae give corals their varying colors.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1090	Some coral have been bleached "plain white".
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1091	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1092	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean.

EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1094	Corals live in in colonies that one made up of many polyps.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1095	Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1096	Overtime the hard skeletons build up and from coral reefs.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	R-11-13	1097	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity (how salty the water is) and salinity can decreases in shallow coastal regions.

EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04842	O	1099	Overall this is what I think of coral bleaching and "coral and photosynthesis from the article + read.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	O	1100	Their different ways coral bleaching, and I think one o the most important one is global warming is affecting our globe.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	O	1101	According to the article "Coral & Photosynthesis", "coral reefs, belive it or not need Co2 or carbon dioxide."
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	O	1102	It produce O2 also just like land plants, but coral are animals, well tin y animals called polyps.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	R-5-5B	1103	The way they get Co2 is by water they also go throw photosynthesis just like normal land plants do, they get their food that way and so do coral plants.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	R-3-5	1104	So the way global warming affects coral reefs is that the way the coral plants do photosynthesis is "Reefs building corals need water temperature between 70-85of because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temperature."
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	R-3-5	1105	Meaning that photosynthesis is so difficult to occure underwater because if it doesn't have the right temperature theirs no photosynthesis.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05196	R-1-50	1106	The other possible cause why coral are blecching is that the wind are getting messed up.

EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1263	Humans, specifically fishers, use blast fishing to just catch fish instead of fishing normally.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1264	Also, tourists come to the coral reefs, drop anchors, and walk on them just to take pictures and explore.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1265	Lastly, people litter.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1266	Factories dump waste and toxics, Fisherman drop bombs.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1267	Ignorant people drop bottles and trash.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1268	Come on lets all do a big stand and help the coral reefs thrive./
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1269	What is Coral Bleaching?
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1270	I'll tell you what it means.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1271	Coral Bleaching is when coral starts getting white and pale.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1272	In that stage, coral start dying.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05019	O	1273	This is also global, as coral bleaching covers half of the surface of the pacific ocean.//
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-4730	R-4-50	1274	The thing that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is if the amount of CO2 is lower than normal it can be a problem for the coral.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-4730	O	1275	Its very important, but it's also very sensitive to changes in the enviroment.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-4730	R-3-5	1276	"Reef building corals need wwater temperatures between 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temperature." //
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	O	1277	There is a type of coral that often mistaken for a rock coral reefs.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	O	1278	Reef building corals are only found in clear, shallow, tropical, waters.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	O	1279	This is partially because algae, and algae is needed lives in coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	R-4-5	1280.1	During photosynthesis algae uses energy from the sunlight to combine Co2 with H2O witch makes O2, as this happens the corals produce glucose or sugar.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	R-4-5B	1280.2	During photosynthesis algae uses energy from the sunlight to combine Co2 with H2O witch makes O2, as this happens the corals produce glucose or sugar.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	R-4-50	1281	The coral will survive as long as it has a normal amount of Co2.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	O	1282	This process (photosynthesis) is very important but also very sensitive and can be affected dramatically if there are any changes in the environment.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-06173	R-3-5	1283	Corals need water temperatures between 70-85o because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in the water tempeture.//
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1284	Coral bleaching is when coral lose their color.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1285	They become a plai nwhite coral isntead of having its varying colors.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1286	Cora bleaching does have a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1287	Its most noitceable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1288	This ocean covers 1/3 of the entire globe.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	R-7-50	1289	Coral bleaching is caused by the death of algae which gives off food for the coral.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1290	Many people think that coral is a plant or a rock but its really an animal.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1291	It is made up of tiny animals called polyps./
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1292	Algae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but coral can sustain physical damage like losing their color.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	O	1293	The most dangerous threats to the health are those that are caused by chage in the environment.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06182	R-6-7	1294	Increased stress on the coral from the environment forces the coral to eject their food producing algae.//
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05735	R-6-50	1295	Coral bleaching comes from changes of it's enviroment which puts stress on coral.  //
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05398	O	1296	There are many things that can cause coral bleaching, but first lets learn what corals and coral reefs are.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05398	O	1297	what are corals an coral reefs exactly?
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05398	O	1298	Corals are invertibrate animals that live together and tend to stay in one place, they made out of coral polyps which use limestone from sea water to build a hard skeleton.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05398	O	1299	And eventually over time, the hard skeleton build up to form what we call coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05398	O	1300	Indeed corals have a little 	Ran out of time//
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	O	1301	There are many different but simlair cause to coral reefing.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-7-50	1302	Coral reefs need algae to live to stay healthy algae dying is a result in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-7-50	1303	corals bleach when algae dies because algae provides the coral with their color so changes in the algae also means changes in the coral reef.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	O	1304	This information is wrong with a lot else was found in the document of "coral and zooxanthallae."
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	O	1305	The text called "coral & photosynthesis says coral reacts to the salinity of the ocean water.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-12-13	1306.1	Salinity is how salty the water is, so too much fresh water from excessive rainfall, like hurricans or tropical storms will upset the balance of fresh to salty water which in return will effect the corals health.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-11-12	1306.2	Salinity is how salty the water is, so too much fresh water from excessive rainfall, like hurricans or tropical storms will upset the balance of fresh to salty water which in return will effect the corals health.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-13-50	1306.3	Salinity is how salty the water is, so too much fresh water from excessive rainfall, like hurricans or tropical storms will upset the balance of fresh to salty water which in return will effect the corals health.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	O	1307	In June of 2013 evidence was found of "coral bleaching reports per year" and starting from 1980 to 2006 each year has had in between  1 -10 or more countries report coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-3-50	1308.1	So to answer the question, the causes of coral bleaching are dead algae, the salinity of water, and the water temperature.//
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-13-50	1308.2	So to answer the question, the causes of coral bleaching are dead algae, the salinity of water, and the water temperature.//
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05157	R-7-50	1308.3	So to answer the question, the causes of coral bleaching are dead algae, the salinity of water, and the water temperature.//
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	O	1309	To start I will be naming a few reasons to explain to what leads to different in the rates of coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-1-50	1310	One reason that leads to coral bleaching is Shift trade Winds.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-1-3	1311	These are winds that move from east to west and can make water temperatures increase by 3-5 degrees F.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-1-50	1312	This type if trade winds lead to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-3-50	1313	Because temperature has a big impact on the bleaching. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	O	1314	Another reason is the amount of CO2 in the waters.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	O	1315	Coral needs water temperatures to be from 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-3-4	1316.1	But if water temp rises, the CO2 levels go down and will not keep the coral healthy and eventually will bleach and die. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-4-14	1316.2	But if water temp rises, the CO2 levels go down and will not keep the coral healthy and eventually will bleach and die. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	R-14-50	1316.3	But if water temp rises, the CO2 levels go down and will not keep the coral healthy and eventually will bleach and die. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	O	1317	Thus coral bleaching has a huge impact on the eco-system.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	O	1318	Coral reefs all over the world are becoming bleached and then therefore dieing.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05214	O	1319	Some of the bleaching we can not control because the environmentat is doing them but a few things we can have stop the bleaching //
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1320	"What is coral bleaching?"
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1321	These invertebrate animals live together in colonies & tend to stay in one place.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1322	Coral Bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1323	Shifting trade winds: This phenomenon is known as upwelling.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1324	Upwelling in the eastern pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1325	Every few years, trade winds are altered.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1326	The trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow from west to east.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1327	The winds & coral bleaching: as I can see, there are higher wind trades.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1328	(graph 1) shows it.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1329	On the 2nd graph I can see the coral bleaching reports this year, I see that there are less coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1330	So, in that case there are higher wind trades & less coral bleaching reports this year.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1331	Coral & photosynthesis: coral is made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1332	A coral polyp is/has a saclike body & mouth sorrounded by stinging tentacles.
EBA1415_SYMS_4_CB_ES-05983	O	1333	Coral polyps range in size from tiny to a foot in diameter.//
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	O	1334	Coral bleaching has been occuring for years now, but why have there been more severe reports lately?
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-5-50	1335.1	There are various reasons to why coral bleaching has been occuring a lot that include shifting trade winds, photosynthesis, and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-7-50	1335.2	There are various reasons to why coral bleaching has been occuring a lot that include shifting trade winds, photosynthesis, and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-1-50	1335.3	There are various reasons to why coral bleaching has been occuring a lot that include shifting trade winds, photosynthesis, and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-3-5	1336	In order for coral to go through the process of photosynthesis, the water temperature has to be between 70-85 degrees F because photosynthesis is very sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-1-3	1337.1	Because of this, shifting trade winds can make water temperature much higher or much lower than the usual, causing the coral to not get enough nutrients from photosynthesis making it change color from being unhealthy.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-3-5B	1337.2	Because of this, shifting trade winds can make water temperature much higher or much lower than the usual, causing the coral to not get enough nutrients from photosynthesis making it change color from being unhealthy.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-5B-50	1337.3	Because of this, shifting trade winds can make water temperature much higher or much lower than the usual, causing the coral to not get enough nutrients from photosynthesis making it change color from being unhealthy.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	R-5-5B	1337.4	Because of this, shifting trade winds can make water temperature much higher or much lower than the usual, causing the coral to not get enough nutrients from photosynthesis making it change color from being unhealthy.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04871	O	1338	Ran out of time.  //
EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06229	O	1339	Coral bleaching is when some corals in the water doesn't have color.
EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06229	R-3-50	1340.1	When the water temperature rises and the trade wind weakens it causes alot of coral bleaching.//
EBA1415post_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06229	R-1-50	1340.2	When the water temperature rises and the trade wind weakens it causes alot of coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	O	1341	The different rates in coral bleaching is that as the years went on, the more people started noticing it.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	O	1342	Plus, climat change affects coral bleaching.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	R-3-6	1343.1	Corals stress from sea temperatures increasing.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	R-1-3	1343.2	Corals stress from sea temperatures increasing.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	R-1-3	1344	Due to wind speed.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	R-1-3	1345	Low wind speeds- allow greater amounts of solar energy to penetrate the smoother water surface, thus raising the temperature.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	R-3-50	1346	When high temperatures from the high sea occurs, the coral bleaching definitely happens.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	O	1347	Coral bleeding, and it's rates could also occurw hen the relationship between thecoral host, and zooxanthallae, gives in.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	O	1348	The tissue of the coral animal begains to appear when the zooxanthallae it's present, and that's how the corals turn white, the white skeleton is revealed.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06265	R-5-5B	1349	The zooxanthallae helps the coral bleaching by carring out photosynthesis, and giving it nutrient that help reef building corals create reef structures.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	O	1351	Coral bleaching has different ways it can be caused.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	R-3-50	1352	One of them being, when the water temperature is higher there tend to be more reports of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	R-3-50	1353	Such as, in 1989 and in 1998 the water temperature was hotter causing more coral bleaching reports.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	R-1-50	1354	Another cause of coral bleaching is when trade wind strength is lower the reports or coral bleaching increase.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	R-1-50	1355	Such as, in 1998 the trade winds strength decreased significantly.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	R-1-50	1356	Which caused the reports or coral bleaching to increase significantly. /
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-05453	O	1357	If you didn't already know, coral bleaching is when coral reefs lose their color or are "bleached" white.   //
EBA1415_TRWH_89_CB_ES-6056	O	1358	Some coral have been bleached a plain white.
EBA1415_TRWH_89_CB_ES-6056	O	1359	Cloral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.//
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	O	1360	The areas sometimes leads to differences because in the passage it says "Upwelling in the eastern Pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific.

EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	O	1362	Meanwhile the deeper, colder water in the eastern Pacific Riase to the surface.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	R-7-50	1363	The zooxanthellae leads up to coral bleaching as well.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	O	1364	Because the author states "In fact most zooxanthellae cannot live outside of the coral animals body."
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	O	1365	Coral bleaching happens from there destrutive practices.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	O	1366	Like in the text it states "blast fishings and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs."

EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	R-7-50	1368	In the passage ot says "During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algea.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	R-7-50	1369	So the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae alage makes it or leads it up to coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-06195	O	1370	These are all type of ways that leads up to different way of coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	O	1371	Their are many different leads to differences in rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	R-1-50	1372	One lead of coral bleaching is Shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	R-1-3	1373	The winds change the temperature of the water by a maximum of over 10F.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	O	1374	This change of temperature can affect coral negatively.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	O	1375	Another lead is how shallow the coral is.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	O	1376	If the coral is to deep underneath the water, it will not get any sun light and will not be able to combine it with CO2 from ocean water.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	R-3-4	1377.1	If temperatures, amount of Co2 in water, or the amount of sun coral gets is changes, it can be unhealthy for the coral.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	R-4-50	1377.2	If temperatures, amount of Co2 in water, or the amount of sun coral gets is changes, it can be unhealthy for the coral.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05598	O	1378	Many different factors affect if coral will be bleached. //
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1379	There are many types of ways/causes towards coral bleaching, but some reasons are because their environment changes.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	R-4-5	1380	According to http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/habitat/coral_index.cfm "As long as the is enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis."
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1381	Also "Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degree F."
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	R-3-1	1382	Some ways this can be changed would be through shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1383	Since there are shifting trade winds this causes upwelling, then "upwelling in eastern pacific." (http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/elwind/elnino.php).
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1384	During this process waters where corals live turns into 3 degree F to 5 degree F.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1385	This is bad because the temperture changes from their usual temperature.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1386	"Zooxanthellae pass some of the food they make from the sun's energy to the coral.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1387	The algae also provide corals with their colors." (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/warming-coral.html)
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1388	This is where keeps the coral alive.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	O	1389	Since bleaching kills zooxanthellae so then the corals die.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04818	R-1-50	1390	But the main reason this happen is because of sometimes there all weaker trade winds which affect the rate of coral bleaching.  //

EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB_ES-05611	O	1400	In the source "What is coral bleaching?" it says "As can be seen in Figure 2, coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean."
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB_ES-05611	O	1401	So there more coral bleaching in the pacific ocean than other ocean. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB_ES-05611	O	1402	Coral are threatened by extreme storms.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB_ES-05611	O	1403	They also need water, to be tempeture 70-85 degree F but the photosynthesis is sensitive in change in water temperature.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB_ES-05611	O	1404	This causes to delicate balance needed to keep corals healthy.  //
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1405	Coral can be a beautiful thing to see while you are underwater.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1406	There are many reasons why coral bleaching takes place everywhere in the ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1407	Three main reasons stuck out to me though, trade winds, amount of Co2 and water temperature, and the use of the reef.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1408	Coral is an animal and we need to start protecting it./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1409	Many times people try to do thing that we can't fix, trade winds is one of those.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1410	Trade winds is extremly important because it moves water all over the ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	R-2-3	1411	In the article "Shifting Trade Winds", "normal water temperature in these regions is 70-80oF; however when surface waters shift eastward ocean water temperatures increase by 3oF to 5oF."
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1412	This can be really bad for coral because it needs Co2 to live.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	R-3-4	1413	There is less Co2 in the air when it is warmer water.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1414	Every few years the tides switch so you never know what you're going to get./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1415	As I said earlier, the amount of Co2 plays a huge role in whether coral will bleach or not.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1416	The coral does some thing called photosynthesis the polyyps, which make up coral, have alge living inside of them, and need it to live.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1417	The algae uses water and Co2 to make sugar and oxygen.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	R-4-5	1418.1	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of Co2, photosynthesis will be done and Algae and then polyyps will live. "It the amount of Co2 is lower then normal, it can be a problem for the coral."
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	R-4-50	1418.2	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of Co2, photosynthesis will be done and Algae and then polyyps will live. "It the amount of Co2 is lower then normal, it can be a problem for the coral."

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	R-5-50	1420	The rate of bleeching is also affected by photosynthesis./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1421	The final way coral bleaching is changing is use of the reef.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05178	O	1422	Reefs do not really get used but, outside things damage it if it is used too much.//

EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1424	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching are that the algae rely's on the coral to stay healthy.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1425	In 1998 number of countries reporting coral bleaching was severe.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1426	Coral is mostly mistaken for rocks or for plants.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1427	Scientist estimate that corals recieve 50% to 95% of their energy from the process.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1428	Corals are sensitive to the ocean water or how salty the water is.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1429	Corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyps.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1430	There are may different type of corals living in the ocean.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04983	O	1431	Coral bleaching is in mostly the Pacific Ocean. //
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1432	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is that if you bleach a coral it loses it's color and it isn't healthy anymore.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1433	And its rare to so a bleached coral that is still healthy because once you bleach it, it becomes unhealthy/the coral dies.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1434	The Pacific Ocean has lots of coral and because of the coral bleaching it affects costal regions.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1435	"Coral is often mistaken for a rock or a plant but coral's are living things they are made up of tiny animals called polyps."
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1436	"Corals are only found in clear, shallow, tropical  waters."
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1437	"This is because algae, called zooxanthellae, live in the coral tissue and need light for the process of photosynthesis"
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	O	1438	When a coral is bleached it turns white and it is not healthy.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05312	R-7-50	1439	It turns white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae.

EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	O	1441	Coral is often found in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	O	1442	It's partly because algae, called zooxanthellae, live in the coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	R-4-5	1443	During photosynthesis, zooxanthelle use energy from sunlight to combine Carbon Dioxide (Co2) in the ocean with water (H2O).
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	O	1444	As it is occuring, carbon is pass from the algae to the coral in the form of glucose (sugar).
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	R-4-5	1445.1	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of Co2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	R-5-5B	1445.2	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of Co2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05850	R-5-5B	1446	It's important because the chemicals the algae make provide the coral with the energy it needs to survive.//
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1447	Coral bleaching is never a thing I would've heard or thought of because I live in the city.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1448	But there is a reason I am bringing this simple yet exquisite title to you it is because the coral bleaching.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-1-50	1449	Coral bleaching is when coral reefs loose their color and turn white.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-1-50	1450	The two main reason for this phenomena is trade winds and coral reefs and photosynthesis. /
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1451	Trade winds were originally used in the 1800's to guide boats in navigation and later also proved to be important in trade.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1452	But aside from that trade winds move water from east to west.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1453	Which can cause climate to change in the world.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-3-50	1454.1	In 1998 due to the high water temps and the low or weaker trade winds it caused a record high in coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-1-50	1454.2	In 1998 due to the high water temps and the low or weaker trade winds it caused a record high in coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1455	Coral and photosynthesis is very important because both can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-5-5B	1456	If the algae doesn't undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-5B-7	1457.1	the coral will not the chemical from the algae it will need to survive.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-5-5B	1457.2	the coral will not the chemical from the algae it will need to survive.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-5B-7	1458.1	So the algae dies.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-7-50	1458.2	So the algae dies.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1459	Also the tempature of the water needs to be between 70-85 degrees F because photosynthesis is sensitive to the changes of water tempature. /
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	R-7-50	1460	So to me these are the main reasons coral bleaching is happening.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_CB_ES-05464	O	1461	How can we prevent this?  //
EBA1415_RCGJ_5_CB_ES-04685	O	1462	Coral bleaching is 1/3 % of the entire globe and contains double the amount of water found in the Atlantic Ocean.
EBA1415_RCGJ_5_CB_ES-04685	O	1463	Upwilling in the eastern Pacific causes surface water to colder than those in the western Pacific.
EBA1415_RCGJ_5_CB_ES-04685	O	1464	Coral is often mistaken for rock or plant. //
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	O	1465	Coral bleaching is bleaching starts when the coral loses its color.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	O	1466	Then the coral has a big problem with a serious impact on the world's coral reef.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	R-14-50	1467.1	Coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	R-6-14	1467.2	Coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	R-7-50	1468	During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae alge.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	O	1469	By changes in there environment that put stress on coral.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-5955	R-6-7	1470	This is because increased stress on coral from the environment forces the coral to eject their food-producing alge.//
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1471	Coral bleaching is when coral turns white and eventually dies.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1472	Coral is very important to the ecosystem, it provides a home for fish, or protection for algae.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	R-7-50	1473	Coral bleaching is caused when the algae is gone.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1474	Coral and algae work together for survival.  /
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1475	Algae is a plant and uses sun light for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1476	When the algae gets sunlight, it makes a form of sugars and oxygen.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1477	The algae then passes carbon down to the coral in the form of Glucose.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1478	In return, the coral provides some protection.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1479	In some cases, the coral is extremely important because if algae were on it's own, it wouldn't find enough nutrients to provide for its self. /
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1480	Trade winds are also very important.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1481	It can pool in extra water making the coral further under the surface, so the algae doesn't get enough light for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	R-5-50	1482.1	Without being able to perform Photosynthesis, the algae can't help the coral, so it will die, and in turn the Algae will die.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	R-7-50	1482.2	Without being able to perform Photosynthesis, the algae can't help the coral, so it will die, and in turn the Algae will die.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1483	Algae is important because small fish eat it, then bigger fish eat the smaller ones and so on and so on.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1484	Without fish, the oceans would just get more polluted.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04812	O	1485	Therefore, if coral were to die, it could mess up the whole underwater ecosystem.  //

EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1573	The reason why they call it coral bleaching is because when it's bleached it loses it's color and becomes plain white stated in the article "Background: What is "Coral Bleaching"."
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1574	They're different explanations to what leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1575	One of these reasons is due to the trade wind happening in the ocean.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	R-1-3	1576	When the trade winds reverse it cause the water tempature to change.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1577	Due to this movement regions start to swell causing the sea-levels to rise.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1578	The article "Shifting Trade Winds" it states that it's more affected in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1579	As stated in the article "What is Coral Bleaching" saying that the Pacific Ocean is where coral bleaching is more done.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1580	Another reason that explains the rate of coral bleaching is the zooxanthellage which has a symbiotic relationship with coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05384	O	1581	When the coral happens to be bleached the zooxanthellae gets affected and makes the coral die easiet since it is a living thing, based inthe article "Coral and Zooxanthellae." //

EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1583	Some differences will start unnoticebly, like some consumers of Coral Reef, they (fishes/consumers,) will starve to death because those consumers is all they eat. 
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1584	Then the other, consumers will have trouble finding or eating their food due to lack of energy. 
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1585	It will then become a slight problem to larger consumers because they can't find food.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1586	Like fisherman, they find fishes to consume and if they can't find fishes, other consumers starve.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1587	Producers (things that create food using sunlight like coral reef) will be eaten more quickly than produce dealing more food for itself and others. 
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1588	Once the producers in the ocean die out, there will be less food for everyone in the entire world.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1589	It will be notice and plenty of differences in food will be made.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1590	If the coral reef die out, large changes in the world would be notice like some fishes dieing out (extinct) and we would even have less food to produce due to extintion of an animal. 
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB_ES-05586	O	1591	This leads a big difference in coral bleaching, soon, we will loose a producer that creates food/energy for animals./

EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	O	1635	The three main reasons I found were the temperature of the water, and if the coral is pared with algae, zooxanthellae, or not. /
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	R-3-50	1636	First lets talk about how the temperature effects coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	O	1637	Coral reef's need a temeperature between 70-85 degrees F to survive at its best.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	R-3-4	1638	If the temperature raises the amount of CO2 decreases which hurts the coral.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	R-1-3	1639	A couple reasons the temperature changes is because of trade winds.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	R-1-3	1640.1	As shown in "Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching" graph if the trade winds are low the temperature is high and this causes coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	R-3-50	1640.2	As shown in "Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching" graph if the trade winds are low the temperature is high and this causes coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04869	R-2-3	1641	As said in "Shifting Trade Winds", "Normal water temperature in these regions is 70-80 degrees F; however, when surface water shift eastward, ocean water temperatures increase by 3F to 5F degrees."

EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1662	What leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching?
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1663	First, we have to know what is coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1664	Coral bleaching is when coral loses its color and becomes plain white.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	R-6-50	1665	The main threat to the health of coral is the changes in their environment, which puts stress on the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1666	Corals live in clear, shallow, tropical waters due to zooxanthellae need the light for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1667	Coral and Zooxanthellae benefit from each other.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1668	Coral provides a "protected nutrient-rich environment" for the zooxanthellae, while the zooxanthellae provides their color and food for energy.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1669	There are different rates in which coral bleaching happens, sometimes it can be very high or very low.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1670	For example in 1998, there was a very high number of severe coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1671	Also in that exact same year there was higher water temperatures and weaker trade winds.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1672	Do you see the relationship?
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	O	1673	Water temperatures should be between 70-85 degrees F for reef building corals due to photosynthesis is sensitive to water temperature change.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	R-1-3	1674	Normal water temperature is 70-85 degrees F, but it does increase by 3-5 degrees F if trade winds reverse direction from west to east.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	R-4-14	1675	Changes in amount of CO2 threaten the delicate balance needed to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	R-3-4	1676	So if water temperature increases, CO2 in water decreases.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05371	R-4-5	1677	CO2 is used in the process of photosynthesis. //

EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04956	O	1818	Another what the coral's lose their color is by not getting the food from the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04956	O	1819	The the zooxanthellen passes food they make from the sun's energy to the coral.

EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05932	R-1-50	1823	The reasons coral bleaching leads to differences in rates is because of the different environmental stuff going on like the shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05932	R-3-5	1824	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temp.

EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	R-1-50	2221	I believe trade winds have alot to do with the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2222	In 1998, the trade winds were at a all time low, and in that same year, 70 countries reported coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2223	This shows that trade winds have a huge part, in rate, of coral bleaching./
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2224	There are many other ways coral can die slowly or fast.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2225	Temperture is a main one.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	R-3-4	2226.1	If a coral isn't getting th needed temperature, it could lose Co2 and lose it's healthiness, but this will happen slowly.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	R-4-14	2226.2	If a coral isn't getting th needed temperature, it could lose Co2 and lose it's healthiness, but this will happen slowly.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2227	The text also touches on zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2228	It states, "Zooxanthellae pass some of the food they make from the sun's energy to the coral".
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2229	What happens if they don't?
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2230	Could this be a cause of coral bleaching or the rate a coral dies if food isn't taken in./
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2231	In conclusion, corals are obviously very sensitive and need proper care.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05092	O	2232	Any of these causes could make coral bleaching happen and potentially kill a coral.//
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2233	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it's colors and it is causing a serious impact on the worlds coral reefs.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	R-1-50	2234.1	Temperature and the strength of the wind trade can slow down or speed up coral bleaching because the weaker wind trades and high temperatures can severely speed up the process and speed of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	R-3-50	2234.2	Temperature and the strength of the wind trade can slow down or speed up coral bleaching because the weaker wind trades and high temperatures can severely speed up the process and speed of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2235	Coral is often mistaken for a rock or plant but it is really made up of tiny animals called polyps which can be the size of a pinhead to a foot in diameter.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2236	They use the limestone in seawater to build a hard skeleton to protect their soft bodys. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2237	Coral reefs are only found in clear shallow tropical waters.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	R-5-5B	2238	This is because zooxanthellae live in coral reefs and need light for photosynthesis and in this process they expell carbon in the form of sugar wich gives coral an estimated 50% to 95% of their energy from this process.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2239	Coral and zooxanthellae algae have a symbiotic relationship which means they both benefit from their relationship.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2240	The coral provides the algea a protected nutrient rich environment and the allgae passes some food to the coral as sugars and the allgae provide the coral with their colors. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2241	Corals can withstand physical damage from destructive practices but changes in the environment can put stress on the coral. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2242	The worst coral bleaching event happend in 1998 and the event resulted in the death of 16% of the worlds coral reefs. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04877	O	2243	Some coral reefs recover from the is many do not.//
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2244	Marine biologist have discovered many different types of corals living in the oceans.

EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2246	Events leading to coral bleaching are a serious problem with a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2247	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean./
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2248	The Trade winds were originally used to guide boats navegation and were later recognized as being important for merchant trading in the 1800's.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2249	Under these circumstances, warm surface waters are dragged eastward towards South America./
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2250	Coral is made up of tiny animals called POLYPS.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2251	Corals live in colonies that are made up of many polys.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	R-4-5	2252	Corals are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters, and during the photosynthesis, zooxanthellae use energy from sunlight to combine Carbon Dioxide (Co2) in the ocean with water (H20).
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	O	2253	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85oF.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	R-11-13	2254	Salinity can decreases in shallow coastal regions during storms that cause exesive rainfall, like hurricanes or topical storms.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-06245	R-11-12	2255	Storms increases the amount of fresh water in the ocean./

EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05111	O	2259	The differences are based on the world changing on it's own, is my explanation for this, in my previous units of studies on the world and history (pangea), this could have a part in coral bleaching. //
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05461	R-1-50	2260.1	What leads to coral bleaching is rates of the wind, salt intake in the ocean also the enviorment it's self./

EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05461	O	2261	The wind is very important to caral bleaching because if the coral is somewhere, where the water is still and all of the sudden it starts moving the water and the coral are getting to much pressure and that causes the coral to bleach./
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05461	O	2262	Also another reason is because salt intake.
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05461	R-13-50	2263	If a lot of salt drops all the way to the bottom where the coral is it is harmful to the coral and then bleaches it's self./
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05461	O	2264	The other problem there maybe is that their enviorment is changing or something, than the coral changes because the coral is used to being in a tropical and with light water.
EBA1415post_TWDG_11_CB_ES-05461	O	2265	If any thing changes it's like your moving their house and that's a new adjustment where to a lot of people are not used to or would have a hard time adjusting to a complete new habitat.//
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2266	There are many different ways for coral bleaching to occur.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2267	One way is the weather.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2268	Corals are sensitive to how salty the ocean water is.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2269	It messes up the coral health.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2270	Another way is stress.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	R-7-50	2271	It turns white because of ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2272	It makes the coral vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2273	Meaning because of the zooxanthellae algae, the coral will get a disease and starve itself, possibly to death.
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04699	O	2274	Some have recovered but some had died. //
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2275	Coral bleaching is another word for turning white.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	R-7-50	2276	Usually it dies because of zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2277	Even though they die why they die is there are lots of reasons. /
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2278	Some reason are is that is because on the Shifting of the Trade winds.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2279	The Trade Winds run east to west.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	R-1-3	2280	It means that the winds blow east to west taking the warm air with them.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	R-1-3	2281	So then the cold water comes up on the shore.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2282	The coral are animals that are really sensitive who need the right amount of tempreature to live.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2283	Even though the temp. help I matters on the weather to. /
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2284	Coral are animals but they grow up like plants.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2285	They need photosynthesis process to grow.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	R-5-50	2286	It don't get the right amount of photosynthesis they change color, if they do they grow coral reefs.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2287	What also matters is the amount of salt the water is if alot they like, if low they don't.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	R-11-13	2288.1	The storms effect the salt so then the fresh water sets and making to salt water disapear somewhere else. /

EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2289	Coral have tiny algae named zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2290	They help each other with living.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	O	2291	Coral give energy to them and algae give them ability to live.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB-05123	R-7-50	2292	And If the zooxanthellae die then they change color and turn white. //
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	R-3-50	2293.1	One of the causes if coral is trade wind strength and water temperature.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	R-1-50	2293.2	One of the causes if coral is trade wind strength and water temperature.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	O	2294	From one of the resources, it showed two graphs.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	R-3-1	2295	On one of the graphs it showed that the higher the water temperature, the weaker the trade winds would be.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	O	2296	It showed that in 1998, it had the highest water temperature and weakest trade winds, are the second graph, it showed coral bleaching reports per year.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	O	2297	The most reports were in 1998, showing that trade winds and water temperature has an effect on the coral.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	R-6-50	2298	Some other reasons that coral bleaching has occured is because of physical damage and stress the coral has been going through.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	O	2299	An example of physical damage is blast fishing, and when tourists drop anchors a walk on reefs.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB_ES-05957	O	2300	Another reason is caused by changes in their environment that put stress on coral.  //
EBA1415_RCGJ_6_CB_ES-05692	O	2301	What I learn today we had 	//
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05934	O	2302	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon that cause coral to lose its color.

EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05934	R-13-14	2307	Also a decrease in salt in water upset the balance neccessary for coral health.//
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05662	R-1-50	2308	The thing that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is weaker trade winds creates more coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05662	R-3-1	2309	The cause of wealer trade winds is high water temperatures.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05662	R-3-50	2310	the higher the water temperature the more coral bleaching, the lower the water temperature the less coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05662	R-1-50	2311.1	The coral bleaching is severe when the water temperatures is higher, and the trade winds are weaker.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	O	2371	There can be many things that lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	O	2372	One thing that leads to the diffences would be the shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	R-1-2	2373	The trade winds, every few years, can be altered causing the trade winds to weaken or reverse direction.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	R-1-2	2374	This also causes the warm surfaces to be dragged towards South America.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	O	2375	This movement causes major shifts in the climate which makes it a problem for the corals.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	R-3-50	2376	As the water temperaure get higher, the coral bleaching increases.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	R-1-50	2377	And, as the trade winds weaken, the coral bleaching also increases.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	O	2378	An exmaple, of this would be the two graphs.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	R-4-5	2385	This is because, if there is not enough sunlight or/and a normal amount of CO2 the algae will not go through photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	O	2386	This is a problem because the algae provide energy for coral, that they need to have to survive.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05531	O	2387	Plus, because of environmental stressors, the balanced relationship of the algae and coral can be negatively affected.

EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05096	O	2513	Bleaching is most noticable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05096	O	2514	Upwelling is when the deeper and colder waters in eastern pacific rise to the surface.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05096	O	2515	This causes the waters in the eastern to be colder.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05096	O	2516	These climate shifts are affecting the water temperature.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05096	O	2517	Normal temp. is 70-80 degrees F but when it shifts it can increase by 3 degree F - 5 degree F.

EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2527	The coloring that corals get come from the environment which they live in.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2528	Due to this it makes the corals different.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2529	Most coral bleaching is found in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2530	In the text is states that "Corals get them color from the algae living within the coral polyps, so that means that the color of the algae in the pacific ocean is mostly white or "bleached".
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2531	I also think that the shifting trade winds have a part of the coloring, because by the wind blowing it moves the corals out of there habitat so they have to change color to fit in the new environment.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2532	In 1998 they had the most severe coral bleaching so most of the algae in that time period had no color that was in the coral polyps.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2533	There was not much coral bleach bleaching as severe as it was in that time period.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2534	It says in the text "Coral and Photosynthesis" that corals could be mistaken for a rock or plant so I think by that being said that when the algae migrates to it and lands on it the coral takes it in as food so if most of the algae the the corals get it turns the color of there tentacles that color.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2535	So if most of the algae is white the coral wil be white thats when it becomes bleached.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2536	I in this case believe that whatever color algae that is in the corals habitat that will be manly the color of the corals.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05048	O	2537	Most of the algae around have been "bleached" and that way the rate of the coral bleaching went up so high during that period of time, it's went down a lot since then though.//

EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06029	O	2550	If it's a mild case of blast fishing, or tourists dropping anchors the coral should easily be able to recover, because these cases aren't as stressful as change in the enviroment.

EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05197	O	2778	Also most of this is happening around the equator where temperatures are Humid and hot.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05197	O	2779	Also corals need hot weather to bee able to build a reef so when the water temp changes it screws everything up.
EBA1415_BLRW_5_CB_ES-05197	R-1-3	2780	The trade winds help this change by shifting temperatures.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2798	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2799	A healthy coral could be a variation of colors, depending on the polyps, while a "bleached" coral would be white.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2800	Coral bleaching has a massive effect not only on the coral itelf, but on the world's many coral reefs.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2801	In 1998, a massive coral bleaching event resulted in the death of sixteen percent of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2802	But what exactly happens during coral bleaching?
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2803	Well first off, you have to see what makes up coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2804	Coral is not a rock or plant, but is made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2805	Polyps use limestone from the sea to build a hard skeleton and, over time, within the tissue are algae, called Zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	O	2806	These zooxanthellae pass over some of the food they make from the sun's energy to the coral, in return for a protected nutrient-rich environment provided by the coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-6-7	2807.1	Zooxanthellae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but when there is an environmental stressor, the algae die and have the coral white and without food, continuing to the deaths of many coral reefs.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-7-5B	2807.2	Zooxanthellae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but when there is an environmental stressor, the algae die and have the coral white and without food, continuing to the deaths of many coral reefs.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-1-50	2808	The most detramental aspects that leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the Shifting of trade winds.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-1-3	2809	The weaker the trade winds, the higher the temperatures.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-3-4	2810.1	The higher the temperture, the lower the rate of CO2, which leads on the death of the algae, ultimately leading to the death of the coral reef.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-4-7	2810.2	The higher the temperture, the lower the rate of CO2, which leads on the death of the algae, ultimately leading to the death of the coral reef.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-1-50	2811	These trade winds always change, which is why the rare of coral bleaching is different ever certain periods of time.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04779	R-11-50	2812.1	Storms too, affect the coral by decreasing the amount of salt in the water, which is bad for the coral. //

EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB-6113	R-1-3	2887	In order for this to happen it has to be caused by trade winds.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB-6113	O	2888	Trade winds were originally used to guide boat navigation, and merchant trading but they have a much more important purpose on earth's oceans.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB-6113	R-1-2	2889	Pacific trade winds travel from east to west, the winds drag warm waters westward, meanwhile the eastern waters are colder.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB-6113	R-3-5	2890	Corals water temperatures need to be 70-85F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temperature.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB-6113	R-3-4	2891.1	In water temperature when it increases, the amount of carbon dioxide or (CO2) in the water decreases, the change in the amount of CO2 can threaten the health of corals which can also lead to coral bleaching.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	R-3-50	2902	These temperatures cause severe coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	O	2903	You can see in photosynthesis corals need 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	O	2904	Corals combine CO2, H2O resulting in O2 and sugars.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	O	2905	The algae provide the coral with energy it needs to survive.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	R-4-50	2906	CO2 can't lower than it should be or it can harm the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	O	2907	The algae provides the coral with its coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	O	2908	The algae and coral rely on each other to stay healthy.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	O	2909	Changes in environment such as the temperature applies stress to the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	R-6-7	2910.1	The stress causes the coral to eject the algae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05407	R-7-50	2910.2	The stress causes the coral to eject the algae.

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	O	2914	First trade winds make a big differecne judging by what they do and the charts.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	R-1-2	2915	When trade winds weaken they blow from west to east which means warm surface waters are dragged eastward.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	R-1-50	2916	On the chart you can see that as the winds grow the weakest coral bleaching is in the severe numbers.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	R-3-50	2917	Next temperature changes affect coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	O	2918	Coral can only survive in specific temperatures.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	O	2919	With everything going on in the world such as natural disaster coral won't survive such conditions.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	O	2920	Finally there are zooanthallae who are animals that mostly cannot without coral.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05180	O	2921	Both coral and zooxanthallae help each other, so if one is in danger so is the other.

EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2961	Coral bleaching is the whitening of the corals that live in the ocean, mostly in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2962	The bleaching is caused by reasons that I'm not so sure of yet that I'm still gonna look upp more on the topic.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-13-50	2963.1	Some of the causes of the coral bleaching is due to the fact that saltine from the ocean is lost because of storms that cause excessive rainfalls, like hurricanes or tropical storms. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-11-13	2963.2	Some of the causes of the coral bleaching is due to the fact that saltine from the ocean is lost because of storms that cause excessive rainfalls, like hurricanes or tropical storms. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-11-12	2964.1	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes salinity to drop.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-12-13	2964.2	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes salinity to drop.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-13-14	2965	This drop in salinity upsets the balance necessary for coral health. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2966	Coral are often mistaken for a rock or a plant.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2967	However, it is really made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2968	A coral polyp has a saclike body and a mouth surrounded by tentacles.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2969	Coral polyps range in size from tiny (the size of a pinehed) up to a foot in diameter. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2970	The Coral and Zooxanthellae algae have a symbiotic relationship.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2971	Which means they both benefit from their relationship with each other in order words they need each other to survive.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2972	A fact is that most Zooxanthellae cannot live outside of the coral's animal body because there are not enough nutrients in the tropical ocean to allow photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2973	The algae provides the corals with their colours. /
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-1-50	2974	I think the shifting trade winds also have something to with coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-3-13	2975.1	I think the trade winds causes calmer oceans which leads to increase ocean temperatures and the heating of the ocean will cause a change in saltine and that can affect the corals.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-13-50	2975.2	I think the trade winds causes calmer oceans which leads to increase ocean temperatures and the heating of the ocean will cause a change in saltine and that can affect the corals.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2976	The corals need a certain amount of salt in ocean and if the heat evaporates water the salt level will rise which can also cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	R-11-13	2977	If it rains then there will be a less amount of salt in the ocean for the corals.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05625	O	2978	So coral bleaching can be caused by many things, so we need to get the main causes.  //
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04744	R-3-50	2979	One explanation of what leads to the Differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the water temperature.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04744	R-3-50	2980	Any Dramatic change that happens in water temp will cause a coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04744	R-1-50	2981	Also any major change un the trade winds will cause the corals to bleach.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04744	O	2982	This can be proved by the year of 1998 when the major increase in water temp and an extreme drop in trade winds.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04744	O	2983	Which caused 16% of the worlds coral population to die. //
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2984	Differences in the rates of coral bleaching are...
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2985	There are different types of corals living in the oceans.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2986	So the rate of of coral bleaching is different for each type.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2987	Regions thata re most affected by coral bleaching is Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea and mostly parts of north America.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2988	The year of 1998 was the worst for the corals severe of those little animals were probably kiled and whitnened.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2989	A lot of people mistaken corals for a rack of plant.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04840	O	2990	The results of bleaching it makes coral reefs get diseases,//
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	O	2991	Coral reefs are filled with life, but coral bleaching threatens their existance.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-3-50	2992	Many things can lead to their bleaching but the changes in temperature of water is big.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	O	2993	Some of the main winds in the ocean are called the trade winds.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-1-3	2994	Depending on which ways the winds go water temperature changes in certain areas.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-1-2	2995.1	For example if the winds are going east to west than the warmer water will move west also.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-2-3	2995.2	For example if the winds are going east to west than the warmer water will move west also.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-2-3	2996	This causes the cooler water to rise where the warm water once was.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	O	2997	All this is known as upwelling.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-3-4	2998	But this still ties in with coral bleaching as the changes in the water temperature effect the CO2 in the water.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-4-50	2999	So the lower the amount of CO2 the more of a problem coral has.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-3-4	3000	When the temps increase then CO2 decreases.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	O	3001	When upwelling occurs then that can mess up coral, causing coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	R-3-4	3002.1	So when the temps change then the amount of CO2 changes increasing/decreasing the levels of coral bleaching. /

EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04817	O	3004	People should try someway to protect the reefs in some way to help stop coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	R-3-50	3005	The water temperature can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	R-3-4	3006	When water temperaures increase the CO2 in the water decreases.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	O	3007	The coral needs CO2 to live.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	O	3008	Coral is sensitive to the saltyness of the water.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	O	3009	If there is a change in the enviorment, the coral can get sick and start to bleach.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	O	3010	If the get physically damaged, they can bleach.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	O	3011	Some fishers come to see an ocean and may drop an anchor or walk in the reefs.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	O	3012	If there is something wrong with the reef, the coral can get stressed out and eject there foot producing algae.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	R-1-3	3013.1	Trade winds happen every few years and it causes the water temp to change which can bleach the coral.  //
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05101	R-3-50	3013.2	Trade winds happen every few years and it causes the water temp to change which can bleach the coral.  //
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-1-50	3014.1	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is when the water temperature is too high and the trade winds are too weak.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-3-50	3014.2	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is when the water temperature is too high and the trade winds are too weak.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-3-50	3015	The mixture of warm and cold water causes the corals to bleach.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3016	The temperature could drop and grow.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3017	For example in Australia they have warm water about 70-85 degrees F but it can higher over 10 degrees, which is above the customary range.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3018	This information I found was Shifting Trade Winds and Coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-13-12	3019	Another thing that affects the coral is salinity can decrease and make the water more clean and fresh but this badly affects the coral health.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3020	According to trade winds and Coral Bleaching it says that in 1998 their was a massive coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3021	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it color which can turn white.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3022	Like I said before a massive coral bleaching event in 1998 considered one of the worst ever observed.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	O	3023	This event resulted in death of 16% of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-3-4	3024	In addition, when the water temperature increases, the amount of carbon dioxide in water decreases.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-4-14	3025.1	Changes in the amount of CO2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-14-50	3025.2	Changes in the amount of CO2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05668	R-14-50	3026	Overall, these ideas leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.  //
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3027	I believe a major reason for coral bleaching is humans as well as eniormental changes.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3028	The humans are destroying the reefs because they pollute and scuba dive and their boats mess up balance in the ecosystem in the water.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3029	All this harm caused by people can cause the coral to turn white which is known as the phenomenon as "coral bleaching."
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	R-3-50	3030	Another reason coral bleaching may be occuring is because of the water tempatures in the ocean by the coral reef.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	R-1-50	3031	Trade wind strength is also a main reason coral reefs could become bleeched.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3032	In 1998 the trade wind strength dropped below -8.000 meters per record of trade wind strength.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3033	This is the worst case of coral bleeching the world has ever seen leaving more than 70 cases reported and probably more that havent been reported.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3034	this 70+ case outbreak is 40 more then the second most largest outbreak.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3035	The second largest outbreak was in 2005 with only 28 cases.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-06236	O	3036	This huge leap is a sign that something went wrong in 1998. //
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	R-7-50	3037	What leads to differents in the rates of coral bleaching is that they'er different types of algio living within the coral polyps gives the coral their varying colors.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	O	3038	It states that "Coral is often mistaken for a rock or plant. Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters." 
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	O	3039	Because if they werent in that type pf water they would die. 
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	O	3040	Coral with the energy it needs to survive. 
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	R-3-4	3041.1	As water temperta increases, the amount of carbon dioxide in water decreases. And also coral turns white due to the ejection or death of the zooathellae algae.

EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	O	3042	Coral bleaching is a phenomenoa in which loses its color. 
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	O	3043	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean. 
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05902	O	3044	Coral is made uo tiny animals called polyps. //
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3045	There are many different reasons why coral does bleach but the rates in which they do bleach are difficult to comprehend since they are so different every year.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3046	Now there are many different variables in which may lead to the right answer however I believe that the rates differ every year because of mostly climate changes. /
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3047	Climate changes are drastic changes in weather for example, ever heard of global warming?
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3048	Some people believe its a myth but it all depends on how you view the situation.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3049	Weather changes every year, there probably will never be a specific pattern but that's what is a factor that bleaches the coral.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3050	Coral is very sensitive to climate changes which is part of the reason in which why the rate of coral bleaching is not constant and may or will vary. /
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3051	In conclusion coral bleaching is a severe problem in whcih rates will diffinetly vary.
EBA1415_SERS_1516_CB_ES-05125	O	3052	However if nature is what's causing coral bleaching then there's really nothing we can do since we can't changed nature.  //
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05819	R-7-50	3053.1	There are many things that could cause the coral to bleach and turn white.

EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	O	3055	After reading several sources about coral bleaching, I have come to some ideas.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	R-7-50	3056	One reason why coral bleaching may be happening is not just how much algae there is in the coral, but how much is in the ocean.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	O	3057	The amount of algae could be decreasing because of many reasons.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	O	3058	Coral relys on algae and other factors to stay alive, but also to sustain its color.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	O	3059	The coral needs nutrients to stay alive and its not getting the necessaly amount.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	O	3060	This could be caused by anchors being dropped or people stepping on the coral because when they do, algae is ejected or dies.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	R-1-50	3061	Another possibility as to why coral bleaching goes up at certain times is trade winds.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	R-1-3	3062	Trade winds effect the temperature of the water.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	R-1-50	3063.1	I found by looking at the graph that when the winds strength goes down, coral bleaching goes up.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	R-3-50	3063.2	I found by looking at the graph that when the winds strength goes down, coral bleaching goes up.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	R-3-50	3064	I'm guessing that this is because of the temperature change.
EBA1415_SEKL_23_CB_ES-04830	O	3065	Coral bleaching is caused in many ways and may continue to happen unless we figure out how to fix it.  //
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3066	The leading to the differeces in the rates of coral bleaching are how the trade winds flow through the coral which is in the Pacific Ocean and also because how the people affect the coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	R-1-50	3067	One of the differences for the rates of coral bleaching is that they flow by the trade wind through the coral by the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3068	In the graph of trade winds it shows how the coral is part of the way of how the trade winds flow.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	R-1-50	3069	This makes me think that us as humans are what cause the coral to be bleaching by how the trade winds connect to the amount of coral bleaching there is.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3070	This is being shown by the article called "Background: What is "Coral Bleaching?". /
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3071	Second of all, is why the people affect the coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3072	If you put side by side the maps from both articles you will see that the flow goes from east to west turns south and back up to north.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3073	The connection is that the land is bring things to the water which make the coral bleaching be affected.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3074	This makes me think that we humans are what causes the coral bleaching to be done.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3075	On the shore there is more bleaching then in the rest of the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3076	There is more bleaching near North America./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	R-1-50	3077	In conlusion, I have come to know that whatever lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the way the trade winds is being flown.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3078	One reason is how it passes to the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05480	O	3079	Also another reason is because we humans are what cause it.//
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	O	3080	Coral bleach is when the coral loosin color making it unhealthy.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	O	3081	The winds couse the coral it disturb by making the ocean hot or cold, and how fresh or salty the lake is or if it has to much achses to rainfall.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	R-1-3	3082	The strengt of the wind changes the ocean temperature.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	O	3083	Over the year and until this day coral bleaching was not going that high but in 1998 the worst case if coral bleaching happened.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	O	3084	The coral gets its color from any alge called zooxanthellae who has a relationship with the corral.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	O	3085	Most zooxantheale cant live with out the body of a corral
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	O	3086	The algae only the corral benefit each other.
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	R-6-7	3087.1	When the corral is stess and cant protect it self the coral eject it algae plus leaving its color. //
EBA1415_ERAP_1_CB_ES-04953	R-7-50	3087.2	When the corral is stess and cant protect it self the coral eject it algae plus leaving its color. //
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	O	3088	There are many factors that can affect the coral.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	R-1-50	3089	First off, trade winds to me seem like the biggest suspect to why corals get bleached.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	R-1-3	3090.1	For example, in 1998, when it was the worst year for coral, it was also the year trade winds shifted, affecting the temperature of the water, making photosynthesis not possible for the algae.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	R-3-5	3090.2	For example, in 1998, when it was the worst year for coral, it was also the year trade winds shifted, affecting the temperature of the water, making photosynthesis not possible for the algae.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	O	3091	These would be the main reason for such the huge gap in rates, because by 1999, it would be back to normal.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	R-1-50	3092.1	So, therefore the biggest benefactor in bleaching coral would be the trade winds, because they make the environment very stired up, messing up the photosynthesis process for the coral, which will not give them their normal color the algae provides them with because they can not create energy.  //
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05965	R-5-50	3092.2	So, therefore the biggest benefactor in bleaching coral would be the trade winds, because they make the environment very stired up, messing up the photosynthesis process for the coral, which will not give them their normal color the algae provides them with because they can not create energy.  //
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB-5576	O	3093	The differences that leads in the rates of coral bleaching for the reason that corals and their colonies are being deceased from natural causes from being fishing.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB-5576	O	3094	Killed from dropped anchors, starvation, disease and mostly hurricanes.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_CB-5576	O	3095	Corals suffer too much that they don't longer can receive energy from sunlight to provide changes in the environment of tropical waters to stay strong against excessive rainfalls, as the remaining corals.//
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06120	R-1-50	3096	Weak trade wind can cause a difference in rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06120	O	3097	Over the year other countries// Ran out of Time
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	O	3098	There different things that leads to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	O	3099	Some of those things are not enough Co2.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	R-3-4	3100.1	As the water temperature increases the Co2 decreases which can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	R-4-50	3100.2	As the water temperature increases the Co2 decreases which can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	R-13-50	3100.3	As the water temperature increases the Co2 decreases which can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	R-13-50	3101	Not only the decrease of co2 but also salinity in the water.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_CB_ES-05017	O	3102	Coral needs salinity (salt) to stay healthy.//
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06210	O	3103	What I think Coral Bleaching is a type of illness that the coral gets when it dosen't get enough of something.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06210	O	3104	I say this because in this sceince writen passage about coral it begins to talk about how the coral got or get their colors in the First place.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06210	O	3105	It says in the passage that corals have these things called polyps.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06210	O	3106	corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyps//
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05801	O	3107	One of the difference of the corals in one in white and the other is colored. 
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05801	R-1-50	3108	I think the coral in being bleached because the water is being shifted all over say the wind, so it might have something to do with the changing in temperature of the water or how high the water gets. 
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-05801	O	3109	the environmental stressors can affect the corals.//
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04874	R-3-50	3110.1	The amount of water temperature and trade winds whether if they are both higher water temperature and weak trade wind and that is when the coral get bleached.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-04874	R-1-50	3110.2	The amount of water temperature and trade winds whether if they are both higher water temperature and weak trade wind and that is when the coral get bleached.

EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3114	The article given to me touch upon the topics or coral Bleaching and Shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3115	Algae is also mentioned in one of the articles.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3116	According to scientists coral's are very sensitive so they use the limestone in the seawater to make a hard skeleton.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3117	Without the help of algae corals wouldn't be a colorful and exotic.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3118	Algae and coral work together to keep each other alive.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3119	The coral is very delicate, so delicate storms and climate change could harm it.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3120	The coral must live in very warm waters.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	O	3121	Because the algae needs to, and as I stated before they need each other to survive.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-05451	R-11-50	3122	Something in the 1900's there was a major decrease in coral due to heavy storms and all around bad weather. //
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	O	3123	The cause of differences in the rates of coral bleaching is temperature.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	R-3-50	3124	The temperature is the main reason for the coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	O	3125	Coral needs 70-85 degrees F for the reef building process.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	R-3-50	3126	Coral bleaching starts when the temperature is not in that range.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	R-7-50	3127.1	The coral begins to turn white because the zooxanthellae aren't protecting.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	R-3-7	3127.2	The coral begins to turn white because the zooxanthellae aren't protecting.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	R-3-7	3128	There not protecting because since the temperature has changed the coral isn't producing food for the zooxanthellae, so the zooanthellae die.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	O	3129	This causes the coral to be vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-05026	O	3130	As shown in the chart coral bleaching has been small, but server except in 1998 which caused 16% of the world's coral to be bleached.  //
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-1-50	3131.1	Fishing, trade winds and high/low temperature rates are what lead to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-3-50	3131.2	Fishing, trade winds and high/low temperature rates are what lead to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-6-50	3132.1	Fishing leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching because if there is a great deal of fishing in the area wehre coral is it causes stress to the coral forcing I to release its energy giving algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-6-7	3132.2	Fishing leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching because if there is a great deal of fishing in the area wehre coral is it causes stress to the coral forcing I to release its energy giving algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	O	3133	When there is little fishing, the coral is faced eith less pressure and is more likely to survive./
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	O	3134	Next, trade winds are an important factor in the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-1-2	3135.1	Trade winds normally drag warm water westward but every now and then it weakens or reverese completly causing major shifts in the water, heating it up from 3 degrees to 10 degrees.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-1-3	3135.2	Trade winds normally drag warm water westward but every now and then it weakens or reverese completly causing major shifts in the water, heating it up from 3 degrees to 10 degrees.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-3-50	3136	This is bad for coral, because as water temperature increases.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	O	3137	CO2 decreases which is what the algae need to photosynthesize causing them to die off, bleaching the coral and killing it.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-1-11	3138.1	Also, if there is an enormous increase in the velocity of trade winds, it can cause terrible storms, decreasing the amount of salinity in the water, upsetting the corl and causing the algae to be ejected, once again killing the coral.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-11-13	3138.2	Also, if there is an enormous increase in the velocity of trade winds, it can cause terrible storms, decreasing the amount of salinity in the water, upsetting the corl and causing the algae to be ejected, once again killing the coral.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-3-50	3139.1	Finally, high and low temperature rates lead to death of coral because low temperature then the coral cannot move as quickly which causes it to die and if it is too high than as stated before the less CO2 amount falls causing a lack of photosynthesis .
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-3-4	3139.2	Finally, high and low temperature rates lead to death of coral because low temperature then the coral cannot move as quickly which causes it to die and if it is too high than as stated before the less CO2 amount falls causing a lack of photosynthesis .

EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05505	R-1-50	3140	This is why fishing, trade winds temperature can cause differences in the rates of coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3141	There are several things that can lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3142	First off, In the source "Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching" it shows the water temputure versus trade winds in a graph.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	R-1-3	3143.1	In this graph according to the data it shows that the weaker the trade winds the higher the water temputure causing Coral Bleaching to be higher. /
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	R-3-50	3143.2	In this graph according to the data it shows that the weaker the trade winds the higher the water temputure causing Coral Bleaching to be higher. /
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3144	In addition, in the article "Coral and Photosynthesis" It says, "Corals balance can also be threatened by extreme storms."
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	R-11-13	3145	It also says, "Salinity can decrease in shallow coastal regions during storms that cause excessive rainfall, like hurricanes or tropical storms."
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	R-11-50	3146	Therefore storms can also be a big part in coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3147	Another reason Coral Bleaching rate can change is by the enviormental stressors.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3148	They can cause the relationship between Coral and Zooxanthellae to be threatened.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3149	As stated in "Coral and Zooxanthellae" it says "The algae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but corals can sustain physical damage from some destructive practices." /
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	R-1-50	3150	Lastly, trade winds can be a big cause in Coral Bleaching.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3151	Trade winds have a much more important purpose for earths oceans.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3152	As stated in the article "Shifting Trade Winds it gives me a good source of in formation on the topic.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	R-1-50	3153	Such as how "Every few years, trade winds are altered" this can cause changes in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-05696	O	3154	Therefore many things can play in the different rates of Coral Bleaching.   //
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3155	What leads to differences in the rates of cloral bleaching throughout many parts of the world would have to be the numerous environmental circumstances they go through.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3156	In the Pacific Ocean, the case of cloral bleaching has severely impacted the area.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3157	Reason being, this area has experienced trade wind which have required water temperatures thus offering corals.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3158	We see the case of upwelling causes surface waters to have different temepratures compare to thers.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3159	For example, upwelling in the eastern pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the Western Pacific.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3160	The health of corals among these regions are at stake due to variations in changes in their environment.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3161	Those corals are unable to adopt to these changing effects union may in turn cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3162	In 1998, we see a severe report on coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-3-50	3163	The high water tempeartures in water have resulted in a sever case of coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3164	With this information, I can conclude that heat amy also cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3165	This trend persists throughout other parts of the world which is why rates differentiate throughout.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-3-4	3166	I also learned that as water temperature increases, the amount of carbon dioxide in water decreases.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-4-14	3167	These changes in the amount of Co2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3168	The amounts of Co2 vary in certain areas which causes a differences in rates.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3169	Back to environmental circumstances, extreme storms may case a threat to the health of plants.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-11-12	3170.1	These extreme storms tend to increase the amount of Fresh water which decreases salinity to drop and it can upset the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-12-13	3170.2	These extreme storms tend to increase the amount of Fresh water which decreases salinity to drop and it can upset the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-13-14	3170.3	These extreme storms tend to increase the amount of Fresh water which decreases salinity to drop and it can upset the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	O	3171	Zooxanthellae algo wold also play role in the bleaching of corals.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05370	R-7-50	3172	The corals turn white due to ejection or death of the algae which makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation affecting it's well being.//
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05001	O	3173	Some things that lead to Coral Bleaching would be like the phenomenon of corals fading and losing its color & also by the coral beginning to become unhealthy.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05001	R-1-50	3174	The shifting of the winds may also be a cause of coral bleaching because as the text states the phenomenon is known as upwelling & what that means is Eastern Pacific causes waters to be colder than those in Western Pacific.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05001	O	3175	So, basically all of that to say tempeture changes.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05001	O	3176	Also, maybe because of the part of the ocean that its in could have alot to do with that statement.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05001	O	3177	But a main part wwould be because of the topics I touched on which were high water tempatures & verus Trade Winds.//
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3178	There are many differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3179	first, some corals was bleached a plain white.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3180	Second, the pacific ocean cover 1/3 of the surface of the entire globe, makeing cloral bleaching noticeable.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3181	Finally, coral bleaching is an phenomenon in which coral loses its color. /
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3182	First, some coral was bleached a plain white.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3183	I forgot why this happened.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3184	Coral bleaching is a phenomenom in which coral loses color.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3185	Next, events leads up to serious coral bleaching problems. /
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3186	Second, the pacific ocean cover 1/3 of the surface, making coral bleaching very noticeable.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05056	O	3187	The pacific ocean covers up 1/3 of the entire globe, and it also contains double the amount of water found in the Atlantic Ocean.  //
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3188	Cloral bleaching is a serious problem because they people are throwing in things into the ocean.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3189	Like in Papua New Guenea and in the Pacific Ocean a little bit in asia and australia and it is most by the coastal regions.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3190	Temperature has to do alot with this because the wind goes west to east when it make the pacific regions swell the sea level.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3191	The coral is a animal called polyps some times mistaken by a rock or plant.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	R-4-50	3192	It is made up of stinging tentacles it has a mouth too it fuses with H2O and O2 and some normal amount of Co2 if it is lower than normal.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	R-4-50	3193	It can be a problem for the coral.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3194	Scientists estimate the corals receive 50% to 95% of their energy from this process.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	R-3-5	3195	Coral need temperatures between 70-85oF because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3196	The environment could threaten this relationship with corals like zooxanthellae canot live out side of the coral animal's body.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05664	O	3197	Because there are not enough nutrient so algae it makes food for the zooxanthellae from the suns energy.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	R-6-50	3198	Some rates of coral bleaching leads to the weather it there is a certain climate the coral is use to them it gets stressed.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	O	3199	Most coral bleaching occurs near the Pacif Ocean.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	O	3200	The phenom is upwelling for them.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	O	3201	Coral and zooxanthellae alage have a symbiotic relationship with each other.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	O	3202	Infact zooanthellae can not live outside of the corals animal body.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	O	3203	Coral bleaching is actually an example of how enviormental stressors can negatively  affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooanthellae.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	O	3204	The bleaching makes coral vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05710	R-7-50	3205	During bleaching corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthallegae algae. //
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3206	Did you know that in 1998 there were about 70 severe reports from countries, that is alot. /
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3207	Coral bleaching is when a coral loses its color wich can be a varying colors, and turns white.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3208	A coral is a living invertebrate animal that lives in colonies in the ocean and tends to stay in one place.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3209	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3210	The coastal regions of the Pacific Ocran are the most affected by coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3211	A massive coral bleaching event in 1998 is considered one of the worst ever observed.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3212	This event resulted in the death of 16% of the worlds coral reefs.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	O	3213	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_CB_ES-05151	R-11-13	3214	Salinity cab decrease in shallow costal regions during storms that cause excessive rainfall. //
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	R-3-50	3215	The temperature of the water is what leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	R-3-50	3216	in the graph (p.3) shows that in higher water temp there is a higher amount of cloral growing.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	O	3217	The zooxanthellae algea is a "close friend of the coral they need each other to survive if one die the other dies to, I think that the zooxantlelo has one important role in the cloral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	R-7-50	3218	When the zooxanthellae dies the coral dies too making it to stop producing clolar bleaching.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	O	3219	Cloral bleaching is a phenomenon in wich cloral loses its color.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	O	3220	Found in Pacific Ocean, pacific ocean contains double the amount of water found in the Atlantic Ocean.
EBA1415_TTKP_7-8_CB_ES-04919	O	3221	In darker areas near land masses is were most of the colar bleaching happens more.//
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05012	O	3222	Coral bleaching is when coral turn white.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05012	O	3223	A healthy coral have color.
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05012	O	3224	But a bleached one is plain white.//
EBA1415post_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05012	O	3225	Ran out of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EBA1415_TRJA_67_CB_ES-06092	O	3226	The rate of coral bleaching is that it was a massive coral bleaching event in 1998 was the worst coral bleaching ever.
EBA1415_TRJA_67_CB_ES-06092	R-6-7	3227	In the passage it said that most dangerous threats to the health of coral are those that are caused by changes in their environment that put stress on coral and that this was caused because increased stress on coral to eject thier food-producing algae.
EBA1415_TRJA_67_CB_ES-06092	R-6-50	3228	I think coral bleaching was caused by the coral not having stress on some of the coral in the enviroment//
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	R-7-50	3229	The leading causes of coral bleaching and upwelling, algae dieing, changes in the enviorment, starvation and defense.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3230	Upwelling ocures when the colder water near the bottom of the ocean rises.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3231	This phenomenon causes water in the Pacific ocean to be colder.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3232	This causes algae to die and the coral and algae need eachother to live.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3233	They are also dieing because of the change in their envionments.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3234	it puts alot of stress on the coral because of the climant.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3235	Alot of coral also dies from desies and starvation.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3236	The coral gets infected and can no longer eat, evetually it dies and becomes bleached.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05105	O	3237	as you can see there are many ways coral can die and it is a big problem.  //
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3238	Coral bleaching can happen in several ways.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3239	Coral isn't actually a rock or a plant.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3240	Its a minute animal called a polyp.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3241	Corals house lots of fish in the ocean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3242	Lots of countries had problems with coral bleaching in 1998.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-1-3	3243.1	If you look at page HSA_2014 of the graph, you will see that weaker trade winds created higher temperatures.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-3-50	3243.2	If you look at page HSA_2014 of the graph, you will see that weaker trade winds created higher temperatures.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-3-50	3244	That was a problem to coral that bleached it.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3245	Zooxanthallae is the name of the Algae which feeds off of the corals.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3246	This algae benefits the coral as well.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3247	The Algae makes food from sunlight and gives it to the coral.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3248	The Algae doesn't just give coral food, it also gives coral its color.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-7-50	3249.1	When coral is bleached, theres no more zooxanthalle, the corals not healthy then.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-7-14	3249.2	When coral is bleached, theres no more zooxanthalle, the corals not healthy then.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3250	There won't be as many fish, because of coral dying.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-3-50	3251	Another way corals could blecah, is if the waters are too warm.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3252	The heat is too sensitive for the Algae to produce any food that kills coral.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3253	High levels of carbon dioxide also kill off coral.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	O	3254	Corals like salty water.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-11-12	3255.1	Rain creates fresh water which messes with the salt levels.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05169	R-12-13	3255.2	Rain creates fresh water which messes with the salt levels.

EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3260	What is coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3261	Many people may not know what coral bleaching is.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3262	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3263	Events leading to coral bleaching are a serious problem with a serious impact on the worlds coral reefs.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3264	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3265	Algae relies on the coral to stay healthy but corals can sustain physical damage from some destructive practices.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3266	One example is blast fishing, and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB-04719	O	3267	In my opinion coral bleaching if you caused you should haave a penalty, because you are hurting the enviroment even if you don't know you should because the actions you did lead to these complications. //
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3268	Coral bleaching is basically when the coral's varying colors have been bleached into a plain whote color and is very unhealthy for the coral.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3269	Infact, coral bleaching doesn't just happen in one way, there several different ways a coral can be bleached.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	R-7-50	3270	When a coral is bleached (due to the death or ejection of the zooxanthellae algae the effect of the corals would be to gain a disease and starve.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3271	Some coral reefs may recover from it, but many do not.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3272	As a result of this, many corals die and causes the coral population to decrease.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3273	In 1998, there was a massive coral bleaching event that was considered one of the worst ones observed.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3274	The event resulted in a death of 16% of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	R-3-5	3275	Another wat the coral reef population could decrease is by the weather. Coral reefs must be in water that is 70-85F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to the changes of water temperature.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	R-3-4	3276	As the water temperature rises, the amount of CO2 in the water decreases.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3277	Because of the changes it could be a threaten to delicate the balance required to keep the corals healthy.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05663	O	3278	Also, coral reefs could be threatened by extreme storms. //
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3279	Not only is there many different corals living in the ocean, but many different ways for the corals to become bleached. /
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3280	One problem that I believe causes coral bleaching is the amount of sunlight corals get.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3281	In the background passage it said, "This map of the Pacific Ocean shows coastal regions most affected by coral bleaching (darker areas near land)."
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3282	If the darker areas had a high coral bleaching problem maybe the lack of light is one cause.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3283	Also in the passage, "Coral & Photosynthesis" it says, "as long as there enough sunlight and normal amount of CO2, the alge will grow."
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3284	Then the coral and zooxanthallae passage says, "The algae also provides corals with their colors."
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3285	So once I connect these two points if there isn't enough sunlight the alge will not grow.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	R-7-50	3286	and if the alge doesn't grow the coral will lose it's color.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05368	O	3287	It seems to me like the light vs darkness is the problem.  //
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-04926	O	3288	The differences in coral bleaching is how//
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3289	Explain what leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3290	Coral bleaching is when the algae instead of being colored, it is white.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3291	Totally not colorful.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3292	You see when a choral plant is a color, it then is healthy,
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3293	but when it becomes bleached itis in a risk to become un-healthy./
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3294	The differences in the rates of coral bleaching mean many things.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3295	Like it depends on where you are and what you see.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3296	You see if you go to the pacific ocean you will see lots of it while in the atlantic you won't see much.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3297	And the less colorful the ocean the less popular it will be for people who don't liek it much.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3298	You see the prettier it is the more people it will attract.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05471	O	3299	And the color brings it nutrients to the many things that live around it.//
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05139	O	3300	The recent reports on coral bleaching have gone up in recent years.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05139	O	3301	More and more countries have been poping up, and they have been severe, thise has been surrounding throughout the world and the coral covers a third of the world.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05139	O	3302	I think the reports wil it getting worse throughout years to come with the amount of countries reporting, and numbers with rise. //
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	O	3303	Many differences from rates of coral bleaching including a phenomenon in which coral loses its color, making it a very serious promble in the coraf reefs.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	O	3304	Most of the coral bleaching is spotted in the pacific ocean near the bottom of Mexico to around Papua New Guinea.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	R-1-2	3305	Wind in the pacific ocean travel from east to west, making the wind drag warm surface water west ward.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	R-1-3	3306	Unforchunaly, trade winds are altered, making the winds go revesed or in a different direction and by makign trade winds strenght weaker.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	R-1-3	3307.1	it makes the tempureture higher causeing more coral bleaching severeness reports.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	R-3-50	3307.2	it makes the tempureture higher causeing more coral bleaching severeness reports.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	O	3308	Another reason is the when coral reach there full function.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	O	3309	They become coral reefs.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05143	O	3310	And coral is made up of tiny animals called polyps.//

EBA1415post_TWNB_2_CB_ES-04973	R-13-14	3314	If the salinity balance is low it upsets the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415post_TWNB_2_CB_ES-04973	O	3315	In 1998 that even was considered one of the worst events it resulted in the death of 16% of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05669	R-3-50	3316	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is I think the temperature in the water because the corals are so sensitive.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05669	O	3317	There has to be a normal amount of CO2 in the water in order for them to keep on living.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05669	R-4-5	3318	I know this because in the reading it says "As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, the algea will undergo photosynthesis."
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05669	R-3-5	3319	It also stated "Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature."

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-06291	O	3322	This is why "coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters." (coral Reef & photosynthesis).
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-06291	O	3323	These conditions are neccessary for the algae to perform photosynthesis, where it takes the power of the sun along with CO2 & the water found in the ocean & makes it into sugars, oxygen, & carbon.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-06291	O	3324	The waste product, carbon, is then used by the coral to make itself food (glucose).
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-06291	R-1-50	3325	The shifitng of trade winds is what causes the bleaching of corals.

EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04733	R-1-2	3354	Trade winds are winds pushing warmer water to either the east or west.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04733	R-1-3	3355	Corals are affected by trade winds when they are very weak, causing the water to become very warm.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04733	R-3-6	3356	Warm water is not good for corals because it causes stress for them.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04733	R-6-7	3357	When they are stressed that is sometimes when the algae, zooxanthellae, is ejected from the corals.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04733	R-7-50	3358	The zooxanthellae provides corals with their colors, so once ejected, corals lose their colors and start bleaching.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04733	O	3359	Corals bleach from stress, some caused by humans, others by nature. 	//
EBA1415_TRDJ_2_CB_ES-06130	O	3360	The differences happen because of probably the polyps and their not making anymore corals so bleaching can't occur if there isn't anymore corals.

EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-04928	O	3448	I've picked these five things for the following reasons.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-04928	O	3449	Algae effects the difference in the rates of coral bleaching because algae is mainly what keeps coral alive.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-04928	O	3450	Algae helps feed the coral and helps it to protect itself from disease.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-04928	O	3451	While in the process of coral bleaching the algae is alive it feeds itself by going through a process called photosynthesis, which uses energy from SUNLIGHT.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-1-50	3737.1	This was caused by weakened the trade winds blow the water in a different direction when changed, then the amount of salt in the water will change, too.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-1-13	3737.2	This was caused by weakened the trade winds blow the water in a different direction when changed, then the amount of salt in the water will change, too.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-13-50	3738	Salt affects coral bleaching, too.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-13-50	3739	This is because when the amount of salt in the water is low, the coral starts to become unhealthy.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-1-50	3740	Trade winds cause all of this, leading to higher rates in coral bleaching./
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	O	3741	Coral bleaching can also happen when the enviroment does not play a key role.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	O	3742	Coral is made of polyps, a try animal that builds up a hard skeleton, forming the sactual coral.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	O	3743	Algae also live in the tissue of coral.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-5-5B	3744	The algae, called zooxanthellae, performs photosynthesis, getting its sugar from the coral, returning the favor with energy.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-5-5B	3745.1	Since corals recieve at least about 50% of their energy from photosynthesis, the coral will die without the algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-7-50	3745.2	Since corals recieve at least about 50% of their energy from photosynthesis, the coral will die without the algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05498	R-6-7	3746.1	So, if too much stress is put on the coral, then the coral will be forced to push out their algae which the algae is pushed out, the coral turns white, losing it's color, and dies./

EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04707	O	3772	There are many things that can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04707	R-11-13	3773	Like change in weather, or a storm happening and it causes there to be to much salt water.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04707	O	3774	Which sense the corals only live in clean eater, it affects the coral which then they become known as coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04707	O	3775	Salt water coming into the place the coral is staying at if not the only thing that can affect the coral.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04707	O	3776	Things like blast fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs affect the coral too.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB_ES-04707	O	3777	So depending on where the coral lies it can be a big part on wether not it will get damaged.

EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3780	There are many different colors of coral, but how does coral bleaching happen?
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3781	Figure 2 on article 1 shows that coral bleaching happens mainly in the Pacific Ocean near costal borders.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3782	Some say its because of tropical storms or hurricanes and others think its because of the salinity of the water.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	R-1-50	3783	Coral bleaching can be caused by shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	R-1-3	3784	If the trade winds change to much it can change the temperature of the water.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	R-1-3	3785	The graphs on Articel 3 show that weaker the trade winds the higher the temperature of the water can be.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3786	Graph 2 shows that 1998 there was a far larger number of coral bleaching than other years.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3787	Graph 1 also shows that in 1998 the trade winds were far weaker and the temperature of the water was at least degrees warmer.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	R-1-50	3788	This shows that trade winds can affect the coral bleaching rates.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3789	Coral is not a rock or a plant instead it is made up of very tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3790	They can range from the size of a pinhead up to the diameter of a foot.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3791	Most times coral reefs are found in clear, shallow tropical waters.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3792	This is partly because algae in the water is very rich and helps build up the coral reefs.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	R-3-5	3793	The process of photosynthesis helps buildup the coral reefs by warm waters between 75-85 degrees F because photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3794	Changes in the amount of CO2 can drastically change how the coral reefs are formed and also the color.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3795	The changes in environement is one example of how negatively it can affect the coral.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	R-6-7	3796	The stress on the coral from the enviornment can cause the coral to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_CB_ES-05305	O	3797	The coral bleaching event in 1998 resulted in our 16% of the population of coral in the world.

EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06161	R-3-5	3808	They need that type of water so they can process photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06161	O	3809	Photosynthesis is sensitive to the changes in the water.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06161	O	3810	They also need to have a perfect symbiotic with the algae called zooxanthallae, without them they won't get the energy they need to keep their color.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06161	R-3-5	3811	When the water changes then they won't have enough sunlight to perform photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06161	R-13-50	3812	Another thing that causes coral bleaching is the salinity.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06161	R-13-14	3813	Salinity decreases the shallow in the coastal regions and can threaten the health of the coral.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	R-1-50	3875	What leads to differnces in the rates of coral bleaching is the trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	R-1-3	3876	The trade winds start it all because when they shift, it gets the water warmer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	R-3-4	3877	As the water temperature increases, the amount of carbon dioxide decreases.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	O	3878	The zooxanthellae, algae, is like the corals partner, they rely on eachother to live.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	R-4-5	3879	So the algae uses carbon dioxide to combine it with water during photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	O	3880	This combination makes sugar and oxygen, but while this is happening carbon is sent to the coral as sugar.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	O	3881	The algae need cabron dioxide in order to keep the coral alive.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	R-3-5	3882	Another reason the water temperature needs to be 70-85F is because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to these changes in the water.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	O	3883	All of this is like a ripple affect, one affects one thing, then that thing affects another, and so on.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05602	O	3884	Son what leads to coral bleaching is the health of the zooxanthellae, because if it isn't healthy then coral will not be. //

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3889	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon when a coral losses its color and this phenomenon impacts a huge part of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3890	The coral bleaching rates and data around the world has been calculated and oberseved at, these rates of coral bleaching are increasing to very severe coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3891	their are different ways in which things cause coral bleaching to happen.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3892	One of the most major things that happen are the trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	R-1-3	3893	Trade winds are when the winds of the ocean change and in which that case makes the temperatures of the ocean increase and make the water warmer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3894	Another big factor in the difference rates of coral bleaching is, zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3895	This helps the coral to stay healthy and to give its foods and resources that the coral needs.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	R-7-50	3896	Without the zooxanthellae the coral will not survive and it will then be a coral bleach.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05608	O	3897	These are different ways in which the coral bleaching rates have been increasing. //
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	O	3898	There can be many reasons why coral reafs are dying.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	O	3899	One reason is that they may be dying because of the changes of the envirorment.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	R-7-50	3900	The tetxt states that "During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae."
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	R-7-50	3901	That means they are dying because of the zooxanthellae, and are valnurable from deseases and starvation.  /

EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	O	3903	Maybe the temperature of the water is changeing.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	O	3904	The source says that reef building corals need water temperaures beetween 70-85 degrees F."
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	O	3905	That means to me that the temperature for coral reef needs is senstatiive.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04836	R-3-50	3906	And if the temperature changes they may die.   //
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3907	Coral bleaching is the phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3908	Coral bleaching is mostly noticeable in the Pacific Ocean since it covers 1/3 of the surface in the entire globe, double the amount found in the Atlantic Ocean./
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3909	Coral is often mistaken for a rock or plant, but it's actually made up of tiny animals called polyps.

EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3911	Theres a hard skeleton that protects the delicate body of the polyp that if it builds up it forms coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3912	The coral reef helps with photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3913	It uses energy from the sunlight to combine co2 & the ocean water.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3914	The carbon is later passed on from the algae to the coral in the form of sugar.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	R-5B-50	3915	This is important because the chemicals that the algae make are the ones that help the coral with energy to survive.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3916	This process is very important to help them survive but it is also very sensitive to the changes in the enviroment./
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3917	The rates (changes) in coral bleaching are different depending on the environment.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	O	3918	Like stated earlier they are more noticable in the Atlantic Ocean.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05675	R-1-3	3919	When there are very weak trade winds the water temperatures are higher.//

EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3937	It is taking many coral's lives from us.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3938	This bleaching has many causes.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3939	Some of these are the decrease of CO2 in water, the shortage of salt in water, & the ejection or deaths of the algea in coral reefs.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3940	These 3 reasons are why we experience coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-4-50	3941	One reason why we experience coral bleaching is because of the decrease of CO2 in water.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-3-4	3942	When temperatures in the oceans rise, that's when CO2 in the water decreases.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3943	Coral's need CO2 in the water, the coral reefs can't make a sufficient amount if glucose.

EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-13-50	3945.1	Another reason why corals bleach is because the salinity in the ocean drops.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-13-14	3945.2	Another reason why corals bleach is because the salinity in the ocean drops.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3946	Corals like to live in salty waters.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3947	It is very good for their health.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-11-12	3948	When it storms, there is a likely chance that it will dump fresh water into the lake.

EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3951	The final reason why corals bleach is because theur food support dies down.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	O	3952	Algae lives in the coral because the ocean does not have the rich nutrients to keep the algae safe.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-5-5B	3953	This is also beneficial for the coral because the algae gives it it's colors and passes on some of the food algae makes from photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-05694	R-7-50	3954	So when algea die, the coral loose their food & colors.

EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04809	O	3967	This is caused by a couple different things.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04809	O	3968	For example changes to their environment, which makes coral stressed out.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB-04809	R-7-50	3969	One thing that is also effected by their enviornment is during bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of zooxanthellae algae.

EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4062	Coral bleaching is when the coral turns white. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4063	To begin with, coral bleaching is something that happens to coral which is in the ocean.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4064	According to the research that I did, it said that coral bleaching is mostly found in the Pacific ocean.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4065	This means that trade winds has to do something with coral bleaching. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	R-1-2	4066	In the article "Shifting Trade Winds," it states that trade winds drag warm water westward and colder, deeper water to the eastern side.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4067	Also phenomenon is known as upwelling.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4068	This means that do to these winds water is moved, which causes upweling - which is what happens when coral bleaches. /
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4069	When you look at the article/pictures, "Trade Winds & coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4070	It shows that the most severe time that coral bleached was in 1998.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05206	O	4071	In "Water Temperature versus Trade Winds," it shows that in the year of 1998.

EBA1415_TRKM_1_CB_ES-06045	O	4076	Coral bleaching is natural but not supposed to happen.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	R-2-3	4077	Normal Water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean are 70-80oF; however, when surface waters shift eastward, ocean water temperatures increase by 3oF to 5oF.

EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4080	Because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4081	As water temperature increases, the amount of Carbon Dioxide (Co2) in water decreases.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4082	Changes in the amount of Co2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep Corals healthy.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4083	The balance of Co2 can also be threatened by extreme storms.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4084	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity (how salty the water is).
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4085	Salinity can decrease in shallow coastal regions during storms that cause excessive rainfall, like hurricanes or tropica lstorms.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4086	Coral bleeching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SDMK_7_CB_ES-05455	O	4087	During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.

EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06228	R-1-50	4089	What lead to the diffrent of coral bleaching is because of the ocean is one reason & the wind.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06228	O	4090	Say this because in the text it says the teamputer in water and the level of heat make different types of reef and when it bleach it make more types of reef's.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-06228	O	4091	So in conclusion the reason why coral reef make diffrent types is because water tempuature & wind's.//
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05817	O	4092	In 1998 the coral bleaching was the wrost observation ever.

EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05817	O	4094	So I think know today coral are more likely to die because it's alot of viruses and a lot of baterial.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05817	O	4095	Also coral are probably most likely to change during different seasons or the wheather out side.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05817	O	4096	And a coral won't get much nutreints during seasonal changes.
EBA1415_HNJD_6_CB_ES-05817	O	4097	So the coral rate dropped more. //
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05705	O	4098	Marine biologist have discovered many diffrent types of corals living in the oceans.

EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06119	O	4253	What causes that?
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06119	O	4254	Well coral and zooxanthellae algae have a symbiotic relationship meaning they benefit from each other.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06119	O	4255	Zooxanthellae can not survive on it's own without the coral.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06119	O	4256	Zooxanthellae passes food and gives color to the coral to keep it healthy.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-06119	R-7-50	4257	During bleaching, coral turns white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.//

EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04759	O	4292	Corals must live in very mild temperatures with just the right amount of sunlight to help zooxanthalle (the algae that helps them grow) produce enough oxygen for the coral to thrive.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04759	O	4293	However, coral bleaching is occurring, and this has a negative impact on the lives of coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04759	R-1-3	4294	For example, the alteration of trade winds is changing the normally mild temperatures that coral can thrive in.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04759	O	4295	Coral reefs are most commonly found near the equator, and trade winds have a major temperature impact near that region specifically.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04759	R-3-5	4296	Coral needs water in a 70-85 degrees F range because of the sensitivity of the photosynthesis process.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04759	R-1-3	4297	When trade winds affect temperature, this can cause up to ten degrees of climate in flux.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	R-1-50	4321	The shifting winds are an affect to the coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4322	For example, in the text the winds shift every few years.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4323	So it is terrible for the coral because they need a warm climate.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	R-2-3	4324	In the section shifting Trade Winds, "Normal wate temperature in these regions in 70-80F; however, when surface waters shift eastward, ocean water temperatures increase by 3F to 5F.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4325	In some places, they can increase over 10F above the costomary range./
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4326	The photosynthesis process is a very important process for these coral reefs.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4327	These corals use energy from the sunlight to combine Carbon Dioxide in the ocean with water.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4328	This happens with the process growing algae to help the coral with it's nutrients.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05419	O	4329	So, in order to have that process work you need the right temperature to balance the 	Ran out of time//
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	O	4330	There are many different factors that can lead to differences in rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	O	4331	One factor being the upwelling and trade winds.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-3-50	4332.1	The upwelling in the eastern Pacific causes water to be more cold than in the west.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-3-14	4332.2	The upwelling in the eastern Pacific causes water to be more cold than in the west.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-3-50	4333.1	This causes the coral to become damaged and bleached. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-3-14	4333.2	This causes the coral to become damaged and bleached. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	O	4334	Similarly, another factor is the weakening in trade wind's strength.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-1-2	4335	Trade winds are supposed to drag warm surface water to the west which should solve the upwelling dilemma.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-1-50	4336.1	Since the trade winds weaken they now blow in a completely reversed direction causing coral bleaching to increase because of the surface water temperatures. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-3-50	4336.2	Since the trade winds weaken they now blow in a completely reversed direction causing coral bleaching to increase because of the surface water temperatures. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-4-50	4337	Also, another factor causing differences in rates of coral bleaching is decreased amounts + levels of CO2.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	O	4338	Zooxanthellae, or algae, gets energy from sunlight during photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	O	4339	With energy, algae makes chemicals which provides coral w/ energy.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-5B-50	4340	Without energy, corals result in bleaching. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-11-50	4341	In other instance, led differences in coral bleaching can be caused by extreme storms.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-11-13	4342	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity, so during storms salinity decreases.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	R-13-14	4343	This drop in salinity upsets the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB-04754	O	4344	"Many of the factors are causes in the environment. //
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4345	The differences that lead to coral bleaching is the enviroment around them.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-11-6	4346.1	If a bad storm came by it stressors the coral out and it loses its color.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-6-50	4346.2	If a bad storm came by it stressors the coral out and it loses its color.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4347	The reason why is because, coral is made up of tiny animals feed on algae.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4348	The algae helps the coral get its color.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-6-7	4349.1	If the coral is stress out then the coral won't eat the algae and the coral won't get its color for which is why it turns white.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-7-50	4349.2	If the coral is stress out then the coral won't eat the algae and the coral won't get its color for which is why it turns white.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4350	The rates and the past few years are severe beacuse of the water temperatures and trade winds.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-3-6	4351.1	When the water temperature changes The coral stresses out and it lose colors and it won't eat.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-6-50	4351.2	When the water temperature changes The coral stresses out and it lose colors and it won't eat.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-1-50	4351.3	When the water temperature changes The coral stresses out and it lose colors and it won't eat.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-1-50	4352	Also because of the trade winds.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4353	When the colder air rises to the surface it is known as upwelling.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4354	Upwelling the eastern Pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4355	Every few years trade winds are altered.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-1-2	4356	The trade winds weaken or reverese direction completely to blow from west to east.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-1-2	4357.1	Under these circumstances, warm surface waters are dragged eastwards towards South America.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-2-6	4357.2	Under these circumstances, warm surface waters are dragged eastwards towards South America.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-2-6	4358	All of these changes stresses the coral out.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-6-50	4359	Another thing that stressors the coral out is tourist walking on them.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	R-6-50	4360	All of these changes bother and annoy the coral and they turn white.
EBA1415_TRJB_2_CB_ES-05021	O	4361	In conclusion this is why they turn white.  //
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-5-50	4362.1	In what I read I learned of 3 factors in nature that affect rates of coral bleaching, they which are changing trade winds, photosynthesis of algae in coral, and the Interdependence of coral and zooxanthaallae.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4363	All of these factors to me have domino effect, if something's with trade winds the rest happen. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-1-50	4364	Starting of with shifitng trade winds, they are the first factor of the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-1-2	4365	Usually, Pacific trade winds blow from east to west dragging warm surface waters westward towards Asia.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4366	In the article called "Shifting Trade Winds," I learned why they are called shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-1-2	4367.1	They're named this because the winds every few years either weaken or switch directions to blow warm waters west to east.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-2-3	4367.2	They're named this because the winds every few years either weaken or switch directions to blow warm waters west to east.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-2-3	4368	This causes water temperatures in the Western Pacific Ocean to drop drastically from 70-80 degrees F to 3-5 degrees F and this is a huge negative effect for the next reason along with rising water levels in eastern and central Pacific Ocean. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-1-50	4369	Trade winds can cause differences in coral bleaching, but photosynthesis of algae in coral can too.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4370	Zooxantheallae which is the algae that lives in coral polyps need photosynthesis to help supply the coral with energy and it's color, since that is its job.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4371	Looking at the charts provided and the "Coral and Photosynthesis" article, I learned that the algae needs warm, shallow water to perform photosynthesis, which requires Carbon Dioxde  and sunlight.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-1-4	4372.1	As in the last paragraph, if trade winds weaken or change direction the water where coral mostly is gets colder and changes CO2 drastically.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-4-7	4372.2	As in the last paragraph, if trade winds weaken or change direction the water where coral mostly is gets colder and changes CO2 drastically.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-4-7	4373	This is the opposite of what it needs, so instead the algae dies off. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4374	Third and lastly, the Interdependence of zooxanthallae and coral is the most important factor to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4375	The algae supplies the coral with some of its food and the algae  gives coral its color.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4376	The coral provides the algae with nutrients.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	R-7-50	4377	If the algae is lost or either dead the coral will lose its color and the bleaching event leaves coral vulnerable to disease and starvation as stated in the article, "Coral and Zooxanthallae."
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4378	This can be caused by stress from blast fishing & anchors being dropped on them that forces them to eject the algae or kill the algae. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4379	In conclusion, there are many factors that can increase the rate of coral bleaching among corals.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-05454	O	4380	I learned that Zooxanthallae and coral have one of the most important and one of the biggest interdependences towards each other.  //

EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05347	O	4384	Another factor that impacts the causing of bleached coral is how much sunlight it recieves.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05347	O	4385	According to "Coral and Zooxanthallae", "most zooxanthellae cannot live outside of the coral animal's body.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05347	O	4386	This is because there are not enough nutrients in the tropical ocean to allow photosynthesis.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05347	O	4387	The coral provides a protected nutrient-rich enviorment for the algae.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05347	O	4388	This relationship also benefits the coral.

EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	O	4402	Coral bleaching is when a coral loses its color and turn white.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	O	4403	A certain type of algae called zooanthallae provide color to the coral in return for protection.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	O	4404	Coral reefs are only found in shallow area where sunlight can go through the water but only in clear tropical waters because of the algae zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	O	4405	Zooxanthallae need light to do photosynthesis hence why corals live in the shallow tropcial waters.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	R-4-3	4406	To do photosynthesis the algae would need light, CO2 (that's in the ocean), H2O, and temp. of 70-85 degrees Fsince the amount of CO2 in the water can change if the water temp. increases.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	R-5-5B	4407	Corals co-exist with this algae since it recieves 50% to 95% of their energy from the algae when it does photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04820	R-7-50	4408	So without that algae the coral would die.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05599	O	4418	Trade winds sustain coral life, but they can also destroy it by moving warm water in places and cold water in others.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05599	O	4419	When the winds alter warm water goes where the water is usually cold vice versa.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05599	O	4420	Corals rely on algae to survive, because the algae provides energy for the coral to live and the coral keeps algae alive.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05416	O	4453	The last cause that changes rates in coral bleaching is human input of dangering communities.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05416	O	4454	When coral is weak from slow photosynthesis, if humans tour areas that are infected from weakeness we can unknowingly hurt and damage the corals exoskeleton.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05416	O	4455	Someways humans damage the coral could be from dropiing anchors on the coral, which causes it to break the skeleton and hurt the coral.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06145	O	4607	Over time the hard skeletons build lip and form coral reefs.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06145	O	4608	"That's just some info about coral reefs, but before I read the passage I was thinking that climate change had alot to do with what leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06145	O	4609	From my prior knowledge climate change effects alot of things in the world.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06145	O	4610	So after scanning through the text I'm assuming that's the cause of coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	R-7-50	4611	A coral is a living algae within the coral polyps give the corals their varying colors.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4612	A healthy coral still has their color then when coral bleaching the color turns white.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4613	Events leading to coral bleaching are a serious problem with a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	R-1-2	4614	How it turns white is from the wind that drags warm surface waters westward.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4615	The warm water pool just north.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4616	The deeper, the colder, the surface.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4617	The trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow from the west to east.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4618	Warm surface waters are dragged east ward towards south America.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4619	Ocean water temperatures increase by 3oF to 5oF as they say.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4620	In some places they can increase over 10oF above the customary range.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4621	This coral is often mistaken for a rock or a plant.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4622	However as they said its really made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4623	Polyps have a saclike body and a tiny up to a foot in dimeter.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4624	Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4625	It's likely alegae called zooxanthellae that lines in the coral tissue and need light for the process of photosynthisis.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_CB_ES-04833	O	4626	They use energy from sunlight to compare Co2 in the ocean water.//
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB_ES-05694	O	4627	Some of the differences are that whens they cant get enghof nutrons.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB_ES-05694	O	4628	It could also be based on the ??? of wind air movement in the water. /
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB_ES-05694	R-1-50	4629.1	There seems to be more coral bleaching when there are weaker trade winds and the tempture in the water is high.

EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB_ES-05694	O	4631	But bleaching coral starts to turn white as snow and look very gone, dead, not moving ect.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB_ES-05694	O	4632	But it's not just one thing it's made up of many tiney animals called polyps and they die out when they cant get enghy nutrons for them to live. //
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05536	R-4-50	4633.1	The things that have lead to coral bleaching were the Shifting of the Trade Wind, the posistion of the corals, the degrees the amount of CO2, H2O, O2, CO2 and the water levels.

EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05536	R-13-50	4634	Also if salt or other comtamantied water lands on coarl it can also make the corals become bleach.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05536	O	4635	The corals are part of photosynthesis and if one got bleached it would mess up the colonie.  //
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-3-50	4636	Some things that lead to the differences in the rates to coral bleaching is temperature change.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	O	4637	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degree F because The Process of Photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-3-6	4638	The most dangerous threat to the health of corals is the temperature change which outs corals to stress.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-1-3	4639	This temperature change is cause & by Shifting Trade Winds.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-1-2	4640	The winds drag warm surface waters westward, meanwhile the deeper cooler waters in the eastern pacific rise to the surface, this process is called upwelling.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-3-4	4641.1	Also it can go the other way, as water temperatures increases, the amount of CO2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy. /
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-4-14	4641.2	Also it can go the other way, as water temperatures increases, the amount of CO2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy. /
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-7-50	4642	During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-7-50	4643	This results in a bleaching event that makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04808	R-6-7	4644	This is because incressed stress on corals from the environment forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.  //
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	R-1-2	4645	Since the trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow every few years, warm water move to certain regions. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	R-1-4	4646	As water temperature increases, the amount of CO2 in water decreases./
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	O	4647	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85F to live.
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	R-1-3	4648	But there are some places whose temperatures are not between 70-85F because of the trade winds. 
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	R-3-4	4649	The increase of water temperature means the decrease of te amount of CO2, like I wrote before.
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	R-4-5B	4650	And if the amount of CO2 in water decreases, reef building corals won't be able to get energy because they use CO2 to get energy./
EBA1415_ERAM_7_CB_ES-04968	R-1-50	4651	For these reasons, we can say the change of the trade winds leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.//
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	O	4652	There are many things that lead to the differences in rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-1-50	4653	One important thing that leads to differences in the rates ofcoral bleaching is when trade winds are altered.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-1-2	4654	When trade winds are altered they weaken or reverse direction, then warm surface waters are dragged eastward.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	O	4655	According to the article, this movement causes the central + eastern pacific regions to swell.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-4-50	4656	Another importent thing that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is when amount of carbon dioxide become too low.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-4-5	4657	Reef building corals need carbon dioxide to become involved in photosynthesis with algae.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-4-14	4658	Chances in amount of carbon dioxide threaten the balanced required to keep corals healthy./
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-13-50	4659	A final important thing that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is low levels of salinity.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-11-13	4660	Salinity can decrease during storms like hurricanes.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05356	R-11-12	4661.1	These storms increase the amount of fresh water + causes salinity to drop.

EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4664	Alot of things really, like algae, carbon dioxide levels, water temperatures, extreme storms, ocean salinity and environmental stressors (changes in the environment).
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4665	Carbon dioxide levels heavily effect the coral.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4666	It helps algae undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4667	And the energy from the algae provide the coral's survival.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4668	Water temperature effect the corals because photosynthesis is sensitive to water temperatures.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4669	A bleached coral means the coral is unhealthy.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	R-7-50	4670	During the bleaching corals turn white due to the ejection or death of algae.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_CB_ES-06139	O	4671	Coral bleaching can be caused by many different thign and can happen a many different rates.//
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-7-50	4672.1	Coral bleaching occurs when the coral ejects the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-6-7	4672.2	Coral bleaching occurs when the coral ejects the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-6-7	4673	This happens when stress is increased for the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-6-50	4674	The difference in the rates of coral bleaching is caused by the amount of stress is put onto the corals.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-6-50	4675	The more amount of stress the coral has, the higher chance of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-6-50	4676	Thus, with more stress on the corals, more bleaching. /
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-1-3	4677	In addition, because of the trade winds it changes up the temperature of the water in several places.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	O	4678	Trade winds can cause upwelling which is when the deeper, colder waters rise to the surface.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-1-2	4679	When trade winds weaken or reverse direction to blow from west to east, warm surface waters are dragged eastward towards South America.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05372	R-OTHER-6	4680	This causes the central and eastern Pacific regions to swell.

EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	R-1-5	4919	First, trade winds decide whether the coral will have photosynthesis or not.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	O	4920	This is because they need a good amount of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis to happen.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	R-1-2	4921	Trade winds bring around colder and warmer water from east to west.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	R-4-5	4922	If colder water is near the coral plant, the carbon dioxide levels go down, interferring photosynthesis.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	O	4923	Second, the zooxanthellae algae either die off or get ejected from the coral.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	O	4924	This usually because outside forcees such as other organisms, or the environment.
EBA1415post_TWJB_5_CB_ES-06211	O	4925	When zooxanthellae are ejected there is no food being provided for the coral.

EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5035	Coral bleaching is mostly in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5036	Coral is made of "tiny animals" polyps.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5037	Coral polyps can be as small as the size of a pinhead to as big as a foot in diameter.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5038	Coral reefs are found in tropical waters, shallow and clear.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5039	This is because an algae named zooxanthellae, it lives in coral tissues and it needs light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5040	Reef building corals need 70-85F in water temperature.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	R-3-5	5041	Photosynthesis is sensitive to different water changes.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5042	This can also be threatened by extreme storms.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5043	Corals are sensitive to how salty the water is.

EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5046	Environmental stressors can badly affect the "balanced relationship" between coral and zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5047	There was a massive coral bleaching event in 1998, it resulted in the death of 16% of the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB-5538	O	5048	These are all different reasons why the rate of coral bleaching goes up.//
EBA1415_TRJA_6_CB_ES-6093	R-3-50	5049	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the water temperature.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5058	In order for the coral reefs to survive they use energy from sunlight to combine CO2 in the ocean with water.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	R-4-50	5059	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, coral reefs will survive.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5060	Reef building corals need to have the ocean water temperature between 70-85F because photosynthesis is sensitive and it changes in water temperature.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5068	Almost most zooxanthellae cant live outside of coral animal's body.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5069	There aren't enough nutrients in the tropical ocean to allow photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5070	Coral provides the algae a nutrient-rich environment, but this can also benefit coral.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5071	The algae provides corals with the color they have.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05596	O	5072	Algae's rely on corals to stay as healthy as possible.

EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-1-50	5079	The major factor in coral bleaching has to do with tradewinds.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-1-2	5080	In the Pacific Ocean tradewinds go from east to west.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-1-2	5081	This causes the warm water to go west.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	O	5082	The cooler waters go east which causes upwelling.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-1-3	5083	Every now and then these tradewinds change causing temperature differences in these Pacific regions (Shifting Trade Winds).
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-1-3	5084	The weaker the trade winds were the higher the water temperature was.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-3-50	5085	The higher the water temperature the more coral bleaching reports occured (Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching).
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-3-50	5086	The temperature of water affects coral bleaching because reef building corals need water temperatures to be between 70-85F.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	O	5087	This is because their process of photosynthesis is sensitive to temperature.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	R-3-4	5088	As the temperature increases the amount of carbon dioxide decreases.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04895	O	5089	The reason that coral is so colorful is because the algae that live within side it provide it with color.

EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	R-4-5	5202	The coral reef needs sunlight and carbon dioxide, to make photosynthesis so that the coral can maintain a healthy life.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	O	5203	It really important to be in shallow water because thats how the coral reef get's their food as well, from the sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	O	5204	If the coral reef has color it's because of algae and if it doesn't have algae it's not healthy.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	O	5205	Coral bleaching is bad for the environment as well.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	R-6-7	5206	It puts stress on everyone, it also forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	O	5207	If a coral reef turns white it is ejection or death.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB-06028	O	5208	And thats what coral bleaching is. //

EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-05474	O	5216	Coral bleaching is a process in result the corals lose their colors.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-05474	R-1-2	5217	Trade winds are winds that move warm water towards the west the west.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-05474	R-1-3	5218	The more trade winds shift, the colder the water gets.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-05474	O	5219	In 1980, the process of coral bleaching was not sit bad but as the years past, coral bleaching became very extreme and severe.

EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5251	Marine biologist have discovered many ways that lead to different rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5252	Coral bleaching is when coral loses their color, corals are most noticeable in the pacific ocean.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5253	The algae is one of the reasosn why there is coral bleaching they provide coral with its color.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5254	The coral needs to stay healthy but it can get damaged because of blast fishing + tourist who drops anchors or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5255	Another thing that cause coral bleaching is the zooxanthellae this passes food + amke sun energy towards the coral.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5256	The Algae rely on the coral to stay healthy because the coral provdies a protected nutrient rich environment for the algae.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	R-6-50	5257	The most threats to corals are caused by changes in their environment, that can put stress on the coral + causes it to lose its color.//
EBA1415_ERSK_7_CB_ES-06262	O	5258	Due to the stress it affects the the relationship between the coral + zooxanthellae.

EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	R-3-50	5261.1	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching?
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	R-1-50	5261.2	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching?
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	R-3-50	5262.1	Its fairly simple its because of water temprature is close to or above 2o a huge decrease of how strong the trade winds are happens.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	R-1-50	5262.2	Its fairly simple its because of water temprature is close to or above 2o a huge decrease of how strong the trade winds are happens.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	R-3-1	5263	As seen in 1998 water temperatures were above 2o which caused a dramatic decrease at the trade winds.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	O	5264	From that happening over 70 countries reported coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05346	R-3-50	5265.1	So you see water temperature and the strenth of the trade winds affect the number of countries that report coral bleaching.//

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-06289	R-7-50	5266.1	What causes coral bleaching is the death of zooxanthellae algae because of temperature dropping. //
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-06289	R-3-7	5266.2	What causes coral bleaching is the death of zooxanthellae algae because of temperature dropping. //
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	O	5267	There are many things that can cause coral bleaching and where it can be found and here are some examples. /
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	R-1-3	5268	One example is that the trade winds change the temperatures of the water. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	O	5269	the change of the temperature can alter the life of the coral. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	O	5270	Also this is mainly happens in the Pacific ocean. 
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	R-3-50	5271.1	This means when the water temperatures are higher and the trade winds are weaker the coral bleaching goes up. /
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	R-1-50	5271.2	This means when the water temperatures are higher and the trade winds are weaker the coral bleaching goes up. /
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04846	O	5272	And that is my reason why coral bleaching is going up and the rates.  //
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-1-50	5273.1	Altered trade winds and lack of sunlight and Co2 can cause different rates in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-4-50	5273.2	Altered trade winds and lack of sunlight and Co2 can cause different rates in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	O	5274	Warm waters is a coral's home.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-3-50	5275	But, when the waters begin to get to hot, the coral begins to lose its color.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-2-3	5276	In the text it states, "Normal water tmperatures in these regions is 70-80oF; however, when surface waters shift eastward, ocean temperatures increase by 3oF to 5oF."
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-3-50	5277	Due to warm waters, the corals became bleached.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-4-50	5278	Lack of sunlight and Co2 can also lead to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	R-4-5	5279	In the text it states, "As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of Co2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05829	O	5280	That's important because the chemicals that the algae make provide the coral with the energy it needs to survive."//
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	R-13-50	5281.1	One way coral's bleach is because when there is big storms the level of salt needed for the coral goes down and is replaced with water.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	R-11-13	5281.2	One way coral's bleach is because when there is big storms the level of salt needed for the coral goes down and is replaced with water.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	R-11-12	5282.1	The text states "These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	R-12-13	5282.2	The text states "These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes the salinity to drop.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	R-13-14	5283	This drop in salinity upsets the balance necessary for coral health."
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	O	5284	This means the coral need a specific amount of salt in the water to be satisfied.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	O	5285	Also the water has to be a certain temperature in order to sruvive.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	R-3-5	5286	The text states "Reef building corals need water temperture between 70-85oF because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperture this means even if there is a little change in temperture the coral could possibly die.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	O	5287	It needs to be between 70-85oF.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05439	O	5288	In all these three things are what lead to coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06214	R-3-50	5289.1	The things that lead to coral bleaching is that when the water temperature changes rapidly and the coral aren't getting enough oxygen and is gettign too much carbon dioxide it bleaches the coral over time.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06214	R-4-50	5289.2	The things that lead to coral bleaching is that when the water temperature changes rapidly and the coral aren't getting enough oxygen and is gettign too much carbon dioxide it bleaches the coral over time.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06214	O	5290	The average tempurature for the water is 70-80oF but it was 10oF over the limit.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_CB_ES-06214	O	5291	But in some places it was only over 3 to 5oF, the balance could also be thrown off by Extreme Storms, because coral are sensitive to ocean salt.//
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-1-50	5292.1	Shifting Trade winds might be the differences in rates of coral bleaching, along with water temperature.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-3-50	5292.2	Shifting Trade winds might be the differences in rates of coral bleaching, along with water temperature.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-1-2	5293	The reason so is because the winds drag warm surface waters westward just North of Australia and near Papua New Guinea is.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	O	5294	According to the "Background: What is "Coral Bleaching?", in Figure 2 coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean north of Australia and near Papua New Guinea.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	O	5295	The article "Shifting Trade Winds" states that every few years trade winds alter, which means it weakens or reverse direction.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	O	5296	That is why on the graph of Water temperatures versus Trade Winds, the trade winds go down.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-3-5	5297.1	Reef building corals need the water temperature to be 70-85 degrees F because of photosynthesis but when the waters shift eastward ocean water temperature increases by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-2-3	5297.2	Reef building corals need the water temperature to be 70-85 degrees F because of photosynthesis but when the waters shift eastward ocean water temperature increases by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	O	5298	In some places they can increase by over 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	O	5299	Coreal & zooxanthellae algae go hand and hand together, most of them can't live outside of the coreal animal's body because there aren't enough nutrients in the tropical ocean to allow photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	O	5300	The algae, zooxanthellage, provides the corals with their color.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-3-7	5301.1	So if the water isn't 70-85 degrees F because of the shifting winds then the alge wouldn't give it enough nutrients without enough nutrients the algae will not help provide the color of the coral.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-1-3	5301.2	So if the water isn't 70-85 degrees F because of the shifting winds then the alge wouldn't give it enough nutrients without enough nutrients the algae will not help provide the color of the coral.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-1-50	5302.1	So In conclusion the reason behind coral bleaching are the change of rates in Trade winds and water temperature.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-3-50	5302.2	So In conclusion the reason behind coral bleaching are the change of rates in Trade winds and water temperature.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_CB_ES-04849	R-3-5	5303	If the temperture changes the corals photosynthesis would be messed up.  //
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05947	O	5304	Frist let me explain what I think a coral bleaching is.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05947	O	5305	I think coral bleaching is like a healthy coral but when people or some animals come along and do stuff to the coral, the coral will turn color to white because it may mean it's dying.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05947	O	5306	Some corals are born white and some are in different colors like red, blue or even green.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05947	O	5307	That's what I think coral bleaching is and what it does.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05391	R-5-7	5439	During the process of photosynthesis, zooxanthellae, lives in the coral tissues, use energy from the sunlight and combine it with Carbon Dioxide to create food, they need to to provide the corals with energy so it could survive.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05391	R-1-50	5440	The problem is that coral bleaching was caused by the changing of the ocean salinity.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05391	R-3-4	5441.1	If the water temperature increases the amounts of CO2 would decreased, which causes less salt for the zooxanthellae to use photosynthesis to provide food for the coral to live.

EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5465	Many people may think the coral bleaching is not that big of a deal.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5466	I didn't know what it was until now, but coral bleaching is something be look at.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5467	Coral bleaching is when a coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-7-50	5468.1	One rate leading to coral bleaching is the Trade Winds and Photosynthesis, and also the algae. /

EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-5-50	5468.3	One rate leading to coral bleaching is the Trade Winds and Photosynthesis, and also the algae. /
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-1-50	5469	First, one rate change leading to coral bleaching is The Trade Winds.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5470	Trade Winds were originally used to navigate boats, but later they were important to merchant boating.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5471	The Trade Winds change their patterns every few years.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5472	Due to this the sea level rises about inches and could grow even a foot higher, it sound like alot but if you think about it it's a big jump.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-2-3	5473	When the Pacific water shifts eastward temperatures increase by 3 degree F 4 degree F, some areas they can get up to 10 degree higher. /
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5474	Secondly, Photosynthesis plays a big role in rates of coral bleaching, because it forms the corals.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5475	Corals are made out of polyps, they are like a saclike body, their mouth is surrounded by stinging tenticles and they have a head the size of a pinhead and the diameter of their body can get up to a foot.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-4-5	5476	During Photosynthesis the sunlight and energy combine and make Carbon Dioxide.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5477	The formation of carbon dioxde they form sugars and oxygen.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-5-5B	5478	The corals get 50% to 95% of energy from the process of photosynthesis, but this process is sensitive and little shipe in be envioment the process can be all messed up. /
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-7-50	5479	Lastly, the rate of cloral bleaching is different because of the algae.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	R-5-7	5480	The algae comes from photosynthesis aswell.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5481	They are formed with the product that the carbon dioxide makes.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_CB_ES-04804	O	5482	Also the coral turns white because.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06156	O	5484	It's all based on the temperature of the water.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06156	R-1-3	5485.1	The higher the trade winds, the lower the temperature is in the water and the lower the trade winds, the higher the temprature, and if the temperature increases, the less carbon dioxide there is.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06156	R-3-4	5485.2	The higher the trade winds, the lower the temperature is in the water and the lower the trade winds, the higher the temprature, and if the temperature increases, the less carbon dioxide there is.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06156	R-4-14	5486	This threaten the corals heath.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06156	R-1-3	5487.1	Around 1998, the trade winds decreased majorly which made the water temperature increase, because of this, over 70 countries reported coral bleaching.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06156	R-3-50	5488	This facet also proves that the hotter the water, coral starts to bleach.//
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-3-50	5489	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is because of the changes in temperatures.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-3-5	5490	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degrees F because of the process called photosynthesis which is sensitive to changes in water temperature.

EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	O	5492	It also depends on the region that the coral is located at.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-11-13	5493	Salinity can decrease in shallow regions during storms that may cause alot of rainfall.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-11-12	5494.1	This kind of storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes salinity to drop.

EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-13-14	5495	This can affect the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-4-50	5496	Also if the amount of CO2 is lower than normal, it can be a problem for the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	O	5497	Trade winds can cause upwelling (deeper colder waters in the eastern Pacific rise to the surface) in the eastern Pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western Pacific.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05381	R-1-50	5498	The rates of coral bleaching also change because trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely  to blow from the west to east. //
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04722	O	5499	Coral Bleaching is when the coral: its self is unhealthy.

EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-04829	O	5569	Coral is very sensitive to the amount of salt in the ocean water.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-04829	R-7-50	5570	Since the algae provides coral with color, if the algae dies due to enviormental changes, the coral will lose its color.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-04829	R-3-7	5571.1	The algae could die form the constant temperature changes due to the many shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-04829	R-1-3	5571.2	The algae could die form the constant temperature changes due to the many shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SEKL_2_CB-04829	R-1-3	5572.1	The trade winds cause temperature to rise.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06150	O	5580	Well, according to five documents, I'll show you./
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06150	O	5581	According to "Coral and Zooxanthallae", in paragraph two it states "...include blast fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs."
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06150	O	5582	This shows that we are breaking the coral causing them to die.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06150	O	5583	Well, I know we human arn't the most protective of our planet but, on the next sentance it states "However, the most dangerous threats to the health of corals are... their environment that put stress on the coral."
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06150	O	5584	So nature is killing itself?
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06150	O	5585	Lets find out.//
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-3-50	5586.1	Coral bleaching can be caused by tempreture change, damage doen by humans, and change in wind./

EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5587	The coral get their color for algae called zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5588	The coral and algae have a "give take" relationship, the algea gets a "home" and the coral get neutriets for food and energy.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-1-50	5589.1	One ofthe reasons coral bleaching happens is due to chang in cross winds.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-11-1	5589.2	One ofthe reasons coral bleaching happens is due to chang in cross winds.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-11-1	5590	This can be caused by tropical storms.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-11-3	5591	The storms bring cold water up into places where warm water should be.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5592	Vice versa.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-3-7	5593.1	When the water tempreture changes the algae in the coral die due to lack of Co2.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-4-7	5593.2	When the water tempreture changes the algae in the coral die due to lack of Co2.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-11-12	5594	Algae can also be affected when the storms bring in more fresh water from the rain, this causes said levels in the ocean to be unbalanced./
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5595	Humans can be just as destructive as the winds.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5596	When humans step on coral it causes the coral stress.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	R-6-7	5597	When coral become stressed the get rid of/kick out the algea.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5598	This leads the coral to death from starvation.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05823	O	5599	Blast fishing also puts alot of stress on the coral.//

EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5601	I think what leads to rates being different is the health.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5602	Some years might be a year that everyone take care of the coral reefs.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5603	The next coral might be beached for 16% of the Pacific ocean.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5604	Another reason might be the population going up or down.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5605	Not haveing enough polyps maybe can cause something to go wrong.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5606	Or maybe theres no enough algae in the ocean they are at.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_CB_ES-06187	O	5607	Their are so many reason to it that I can't explain.//
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06072	O	5608	Coral bleaching is a tameable thing in the side effect of them dieing.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06072	O	5609	If coral reef die then agie can't grow and if allgure with polyps feed on but if the polyps die then.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06072	O	5610	There won't be food for small fish and what do big fish eat, small fish both will die witohut the coral reef.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06072	O	5611	And it will be ashame to find a betufly work of naurtal vanish like that.

EBA1415_RCGJa_5_CB_ES-04688	O	5615	The things that lead to rate of coral bleaching is when which the coral lose its color and how the algae give its it color.
EBA1415_RCGJa_5_CB_ES-04688	O	5616	its more hot found on the pacific ocean. //
EBA1415_BGJD_1_CB_ES-05728	R-7-50	5617	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is that once that happens during bleaching it turns white because of the ejection of the zooxanthellae algae it means it has been dead which is why healthy coral is a much brighter color and the bleached coral is just white that means it's dead.  //
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05836	O	5618	Coral bleaching is caused by many things.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05836	O	5619	Corals go through a process that the coral reacts to it by changing color in a way being "bleached" it usually turns to a faint off-white or white color.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05836	R-7-50	5620	Coral bleaching can be caused by the algae in the coral dying or becoming sick of starvation.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05836	R-11-13	5621	Extreme storms can cause extreme salinity (how salty the water is) it causes the coral to have a disbalance in its health.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_CB_ES-05836	O	5622	Stress also can cause discoloration blast fishing, dropping anchors or walking on the reefs cause the corals stress. //
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05050	R-1-50	5623	The shifting trade winds leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching and also indifferent places of the earth that is where you can find more bleached coral.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05050	O	5624	You can find it more around Asia, new Guinea, and North America.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05050	R-1-50	5625	Wherever the weaker trade winds are that year the higher the coral bleaching reports are.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05050	R-1-50	5626	When the trade winds decrease the higher amount of coral bleachings, but the higher the trade winds the lower amount of bleached coral there is.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05050	R-1-50	5627	So when the trade winds change that changes the coral if the winds are high the coral bleaching is low and if the winds are low the coral bleaching becomes higher and higher.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05050	O	5628	The most severe coral bleaching was in 1998 the coral bleaching was up to 75% and the winds were -9000% in 1998.//

EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	O	5631	Coral is made up of tiny animals called polps.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	O	5632	Polyps use limestone from seawater to develope a hard skeleton, this protects the delicate body of the polyps.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	O	5633	Over time this skeleton builds up and form coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	O	5634	Different types of algae gives coral their varying colors.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	R-12-14	5635	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity, fresh water is bad for coral's health.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	R-6-7	5636	Most dangerous threats to the heath of corals are those that caused by the human pollution and global warming. It put stress on coral causes to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	R-7-50	5637	During bleaching, corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the 'zooxanthellae' algae, this makes corals vulnerable to diease and starvation.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05685	O	5638	This might cause coral reefs to extinct if humans don't know about the causes and will be taken from the fishes in the sea or ocean. //
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05093	R-1-50	5639	Trade winds affect the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05093	R-3-50	5640.1	When water temperatures are higher and trade winds are lower, more countries end up reporting that they have witnessed coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05093	R-1-50	5640.2	When water temperatures are higher and trade winds are lower, more countries end up reporting that they have witnessed coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05093	R-2-3	5641	When major shifts in the earth's movement causes warm water to move eastward, the water temperature can increase by almost 10o above the normal water temperature.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05093	O	5642	As shown on the Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching graphs, by 1998, there were weaker trade winds than any other year, but it had higher water temperatures than most of the years.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05093	O	5643	Finally, if you look at the "Coral Bleaching" Reports per year "Graph, you can see that by 1998, coral bleaching reports were severely high, and the highest on the chart.//

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-1-50	5651	There are many ways to explain the rates in coral bleaching like Trade Winds, a balanced environment, and physical damage./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-1-50	5652	First of all trade winds are one of the reasons coral bleaching is happening.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-1-3	5653	Since coral needs a stable environement, the problem is that when trade winds go down, the heat of the water goes up.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-1-3	5654.1	Since photosynthesis needs temperature between 70-85 degrees and the trade wind make water warmer than that it decreases the amount of CO2 in the water.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-3-4	5654.2	Since photosynthesis needs temperature between 70-85 degrees and the trade wind make water warmer than that it decreases the amount of CO2 in the water.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-3-14	5655.1	This is important because if the water is warmer and theirs less CO2 then the coral gets unhealthy./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-4-14	5655.2	This is important because if the water is warmer and theirs less CO2 then the coral gets unhealthy./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	O	5656	Another reason why coral bleaching is happening, is because of an unstable environment.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	O	5657	Theirs many ways an an unstable environment may happen, like extreme storms, enough sunlight, and a stable amount of CO2.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-11-13	5658	Extreme storms are a problem because storms decrease the amount of salt in an area.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	O	5659	I the coral doesn't get enough sunlight It will bleach itself.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	R-4-50	5660	I the coral doesn't get enough CO2 it will also belach itself.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	O	5661	Finally physical damage also adds to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	O	5662	These include blast fishing is one of the ways large amounts of coral bleach.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05185	O	5663	Also Anchors and people walking on reef, either destroys the entire coral or bleaches it./

EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5665	Coral bleaching is when corals turn white.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5666	Coral bleaching is happening where the corals are closest to land.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5667	Corals are very delicate and they get stressed esaily.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5668	Corals are actualy made of small animals.

EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5670	There are many explanations to why corals turn white.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5671	Some things or reasons are because of wind change, tempeature in the water and climate change as well.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5672	Once these beautiful bright colored corals turn white they are basicly dieing.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-04923	O	5673	They starve, they don't eat like they used to and of course they turn white.

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05183	O	5693	One way is the drop in temperature and te increase in temperature.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05183	R-3-13	5694	If the temp does down then the salinity in the water decreases as well making the coral stay healthy.

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05183	O	5701	Finally, last, but not least another way coral has been getting bleached is by the different trade currancy for wind.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05183	O	5702	This causes different temperatures in the sky.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05183	O	5703	This also causes it to have different weathers for the coral./

EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04837	O	5705	What I think that leads the differences in coral bleaching is that there is different types of corals living in the oceans.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04837	O	5706	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04837	R-4-5B	5707	In the article it saids that "scientists estimate that corals receive 50% to 95% of their energy from the amount of Co2 for the coral."
EBA1415_SWAF_6_CB_ES-04837	O	5708	Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical waters it is because of algae.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	O	5742	Coral bleaching is huge problem that greatly impacts the reefs (coral) around the world.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	O	5743	COral bleaching mostly occurs when the environment around the coral changes. /
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	O	5744	the environment is a huge factor involving the health of coral because the changes in the environment put stress onto the reef.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	R-6-7	5745.1	As the stress on coral increases it forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	R-1-50	5748	One of the changes in the enviornment that will simulate the bleaching is trade winds.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	R-1-3	5749	Trade winds weaken and/or change direction when a trade wind occurs the water will also, obviously, change the way it moves/flows, which affects everything in the water./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	R-3-50	5750	In addition to trade winds, the water temperature affects coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	O	5751	For the coral to be healthy the temperature needs to be in the range of 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05526	O	5752	Otherwise, the reef has trouble doing the process of photosynthesis, this process helps the coral strive, without it the plant will slowly start to die. /

EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5760	Why does this occur?
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5761	Many do not know this, but coral bleaching is caused by changes in the coral's environment. /
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5762	The first environment change that has an impact on a coral's state of being is trade winds.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5763	Trade winds cause what is called upwelling, or changes in surface waters, in areas near Australia, a popular habitat for coral.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	R-1-3	5764	Every few years, trade winds alter directions, and bring warm or cold waters than can increase or decrease by up to 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	R-1-50	5765.1	Patterns of weak trade winds and high water temperatures have been shown to correlate diectly with an increase in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	R-3-50	5765.2	Patterns of weak trade winds and high water temperatures have been shown to correlate diectly with an increase in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5766	IN 1998, water temperature was at an all time high, and nearly 80 countries reported coral bleaching./
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5767	The second environmental change that impacts rates of coral bleaching is CO2 levels and sunlight.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5768	It is not a well-known fact, but coral actualy recieve their energy from a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthallae algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5769	Carbon dioxide levels and ability to reach sunligh from the Ocean could affect and cause photosynthesis in the zooxanthallae algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5770	If CO2 is lower than normal, photosynthesis will be problematic for algae, thereby affecting the coral, as chemicals the algae give off during photosynthesis provide corals energy.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	R-3-4	5771	The water temperatures mentioned in paragraph one are also a factor in CO2 levels in the waters, as when water temperature increases, CO2 levels decrease. /
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5772	The final change in the enviornment which is contributing to coral bleaching is human damage.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5773	As coral depend on algae for energy, algae depend on coral to stay healthy and provide nutrients.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	O	5774	Human activities such as blast fishing, tourists who drop anchors on the coral, or walking in the reefs cause coral to undergo stress, which begins the coral's reaction to stress, which begins the coral's reaction to stress.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	R-6-7	5775	Coral responds to stress by ejectng their food-producing algae, and all their source of energy.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05513	R-7-50	5776	Coral then turn the white color due to their lack of zooxanthallae algae, which have died off due to lack of access to coral's nutrient-rich enviornment. //

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04775	O	5913	There are many things that are causing the coral to lose its color, one example is upwelling.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04775	O	5914	Upwelling is a phenomenon of its own, it is when the surface of the water is colder than it should be.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04775	O	5915	Upwelling is caused by shifting trade winds with a lower climate on the surface of the water is a factor of why the coral is bleaching, this is because the coral is closer to the surface than other plants may be.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04775	O	5916	The coral has to be closer to the surface due to photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04775	O	5917	Coral is made up of tiny animals called polyps.

EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04899	R-7-50	5930	And the cause of that is of the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae their relationship isn't together so the healthy coral goes into a coral bleaching because it doesn't have the algae.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04899	O	5931	Only of the algae was there it would totally be less of coral bleaching but there's more because its so easy to spot and basically they find more.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04899	O	5932	Sometimes the coral doesnt get enough algae because for algae to grow they need light and there is not much light where the algae and coral is.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_CB_ES-04899	R-5-5B	5933	That is needed for photosynthesis to form or as others may say "to undergo" and thats good because the chemicals that the algae comes with thats or those are the things that provide corals with the correct energy amounts that needed.  //

EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05138	R-7-50	5985	Corals turn white during bleaching because of the effect that the algaeas death leaves on the animal.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05138	R-7-50	5986	This is because corals get their different colors from the algae living within them.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	5999	In the year of 1998 coral bleaching was most severe.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6000	However, before this year the number of countries reporting coral bleaching was about 11 countries per year.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6001	But in 1998 more than 70 countries reported coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6002	Corals and their polyps are delicate.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6003	Many factors like temperature, amount of CO2 & amount of salinity effect corals.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6004	First of all corals live in clear, shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	R-5-5B	6005	The algae in coral need light to make photosynthesis so they can be provided with the energy to survive.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	R-1-2	6006	However, due to shifting trade winds, the movement of the water goes eastward.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6007	Therefore, temperature increase from about 80 degrees F to 5 degrees F.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6008	The temperature change can greatly impact the coral because when a coral undergoes photosynthesis it needs to have a specific amount of temperature & not too much water so it can recieve light to make photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6009	Due to climate change, corals may not be making enough photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	R-3-4	6010.1	So as the water temperature increases CO2 in the water decreases.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	R-4-50	6010.2	So as the water temperature increases CO2 in the water decreases.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	R-4-50	6011	As a result the corals fragile health can be deteriorating. /
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	R-13-14	6012	Furthermore, as salinity in the ocean decreases due to climate change then this again upsets the corals health because they are sensitive to how salty the water is.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6013	In the summer when tourists visit the tropcial places near Australia & the Pacific Ocean they don't know that when they do blastfishing, or drop anchors on reefs or walk on the reefs, that they are hurting the coral & it's health.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05517	O	6014	Therefore, people also are a factor to why the corals health is deterdorating. //
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6015	Coral bleaching change almost every year it would go from mild, moderate to severe.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6016	Coral temperture changes it would be 70-85F the proces of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperture.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6017	Coral bleaching are a serious problem with an impact./
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6018	There is coral bleaching reports per year they change every year it does not stay the same as it used to be.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6019	Some come out to be not many reports, other come put to be high reports.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6020	As many reports.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6021	Some would be mild, moderate to severe reports./
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6022	The highest report for cloral bleaching was on the 1998's there was about 71 or 72 countries reporting cloral bleaching anf they were many severe reports and a couple moderate and mild reports./
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05213	O	6023	The lowest report 1988 where there was only about 1,2, or 3 countries that reported in the cloral bleaching and it was severe.//
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	O	6024	There are many factors that lead to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	O	6025	One of these factors is the trade wind strength and water temperature.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-3-50	6026.1	When the trade winds were weak and the water temperature was high, the coral bleaching reports showed a severe amount of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-1-50	6026.2	When the trade winds were weak and the water temperature was high, the coral bleaching reports showed a severe amount of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	O	6027	There were about more than 70 countries with coral bleaching during that year.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-6-14	6028	Another one of these factors is that the stressors that can harm the relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae algae are blast fishing and the anchors that tourists use.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	O	6029	The anchors can destroy the corals if it falls on top them.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	O	6030	If it does, the coral can't provide a nutrient-rich environment for the algae causing them to stop providing the coral with its color and food.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-7-50	6031	Because the coral ejects their algae, the algae dies and the coral begins to turn white and is vulnerable to getting diseases and no food.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-3-50	6032	The water temperature also leads to differences in coral bleaching rates.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	O	6033	The algea ??? sun and warm water inorder for photosynthesis to happen.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-3-5	6034.1	If the water temperature was colder, then photosynthesis would not happen, the algae would die too. 	Ran out of time//
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05386	R-5-7	6034.2	If the water temperature was colder, then photosynthesis would not happen, the algae would die too. 	Ran out of time//
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05922	O	6035	What lead's to differences in the rate's of coral bleaching is the affect cural bleaching does to the ocean.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05922	O	6036	Also the rating of number of countries reporting coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05922	O	6037	As the year's went by the number of reporting coral bleaching decreased.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05922	O	6038	Also coral's can sustain physical damage from some distructive practices.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05922	O	6039	Change in coral's environment put stress on coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05922	R-6-7	6040	This is because increased stress on corals from the evionment forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae. 	Did not have time to finish. //
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-05989	O	6041	Different circumstances lead to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-05989	O	6042	For example, trade winds.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-05989	R-2-3	6043.1	Trade winds are strong winds and every few years they go weak and go eastward, leading to an increase of water temperature, leading to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-05989	R-3-50	6043.2	Trade winds are strong winds and every few years they go weak and go eastward, leading to an increase of water temperature, leading to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB-05989	O	6044	In the years were trades are strong//
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6045	The differences between coral bleaching is one can be very harmful and the other one can be very harmful and the other one can happen but then the reef will regain its color.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6046	A tiny animal named Polyps are making up the reefs.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6047	When they are hit with salt water they, build a hard skeleton and that changes colors.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6048	Over time the coral reefs will form, and will eventually lose color.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6049	When the corals change color that is called coral bleaching.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6050	There could be different rates of coral bleaching
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	O	6051	One rate could have to do with Trade Winds and how they go over the ocean.
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	R-1-3	6052.1	The trade winds could change the temperature of the water causing the coral to change in appearance. //
EBA1415_RDCS_1_CB_ES-04698	R-3-50	6052.2	The trade winds could change the temperature of the water causing the coral to change in appearance. //
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	R-7-50	6053	What leads to coral bleaching is algae dying.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	O	6054	You see there are different types of algae living within corals.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	O	6055	The algae gives the coral their varying colors.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	R-7-50	6056	When algae starts to die, corals begin to become plain white.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	O	6057	So the question is, what makes algae start to die?
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	R-5-7	6058	What makes algae die is not being able to go through the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	R-7-50	6059	If the algae can't eat it will die, allowing the coral to die.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	R-3-7	6060	What doesn't allow algae to go troug the process is the water temperature.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05322	R-3-5	6061	Reef building corals need water tempatures between 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitve to change in water temperatures change to the environment, fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs, are all examples of how coral's being to loss their colors.  //
EBA1415_RDCSa_1_CB_ES-04694	O	6062	Coral Bleaching leads to differences  //
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-7-50	6063	The factors that lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching can be from ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	O	6064	The reason why the coral becomes white is because the zooxanthellae algae, gives the coral its color, also the algae passes some of the food they make from the son's energy to the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	O	6065	Without the zooxanthellae algae the coral becomes vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-14-50	6066.1	Coral bleaching is an example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balance relationship between the coral zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-6-14	6066.2	Coral bleaching is an example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balance relationship between the coral zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	O	6067	The most dangerous threats to the health of corals are changes in their enviornment.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-6-7	6068	Increased stress on corals from the enviornment forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	O	6069	Another threat is extreme storms.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	O	6070	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-11-12	6071.1	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes salinity to drop.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-12-13	6071.2	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes salinity to drop.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-13-14	6071.3	These storms increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes salinity to drop.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	R-13-14	6072	This drop upsets the balance necessary for coral health./
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05405	O	6073	In conclusion, the factors are ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae or a change in their environment. //
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	O	6074	Coral bleaching is a very serious event that has happened for many years now.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	R-11-50	6075	There are many reasons coral bleaching happenes.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	O	6076	Some of the ways it happenes is the enviorment changing.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	R-11-50	6077	If there are extreme storms.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	R-11-13	6078	It can effect the coral because, the rain makes the salinity in the water decrease and the coral is very sensitive to that change.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	O	6079	Coral is made up with zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	R-7-50	6080	If that algae dies, it makes the coral bleach white and make it vulnerable to diease & starvation.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	O	6081	They can also sustain to physical damage, when people blast fish, drop anchors and/or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	O	6082	They are very sensetive and get broken and will eventually die.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	R-4-14	6083	When the amount of Co2 threaten the delicate balance to keep the corals healthy.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_CB_ES-05936	O	6084	People need to take into concideration our living creatures under the water when they are doing blast fishing, dropping anchors and just walking because we need them and we can't control mother nature but we can control physical actions that we do to harm the coral.//
EBA1415_TWMD_6_CB-5005	R-3-50	6085	What leads to changes in rate in coral bleaching is the water temperature.
EBA1415_TWMD_6_CB-5005	R-3-50	6086	When the water temperature rises so does coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TWMD_6_CB-5005	R-3-50	6087	In the two graphs it shows in 1998 the water rising very high and so do coral bleaching the next year the temperature dropped and so did coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TWMD_6_CB-5005	O	6088	Trade winds also causes upwelling which could be another cause for coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TWMD_6_CB-5005	O	6089	Upwelling causes the the deeper colder water to rise to the surface.
EBA1415_TWMD_6_CB-5005	O	6090	Which would leave the corals with less cold water that gives it's color.//
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6091	Corals are tiny colonies that are made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6092	Corals have bestfriend called zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6093	They go hand in hand and cannot survive without each other.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6094	Zooxanthallae is the organism that supplies food and color as well as protection for the corals.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6095	These organisms take in sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to create sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to create glucose (sugar) for the polyps.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6096	This can be found the "Coral & Photosynthesis" document.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6097	Acording to the document "Coral and Zooxanthallae" it states that the algae relies on the coral.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6098	But the coral also relies on the algae.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6099	Algae protects the coral but the coral helps it stay alive.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6100	When there is an inturruption or an imbalance of something the zooanthallae stops creating the corals nessecities.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	R-5B-7	6101	Once the coral stops recieving its food it stops working and the algae dies off.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6102	This leaves the coral with no food, color anf protection, which makes it extreamly difficult for them to survive.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6103	When corals are left without color they sustain a white color, this is known as coral bleaching mentioned in document "Coral and Zooxanthallae."
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB-04814	O	6104	Corals are extreamly sensative to their surroundings.

EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05639	O	6131	Coral bleaching is a phenomenom.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05639	O	6132	In this article it tell us they are many diffrent type of corals.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_CB_ES-05639	O	6133	Corals are mistaken most of the time with a rock or plant however it's really made up of tiny animals called polyps.

EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	O	6425	To start of, weather is a cause.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	O	6426	Say a hurricane goes through or by a coral reef.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	R-13-14	6427	Corals are very sensitive to how much salt is in the water, and it affects their health.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	R-13-50	6428	So, the lack of salt in the water may weaken or sicken the coral, turning them white. /
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	O	6429	Another cause is the water temperature.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	O	6430	The corals need the water to be between 70-85 degrees F in order for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	R-3-4	6431	If the water goes over that limit, the amount of CO2 decreases.

EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	R-6-7	6438	When stress is put on coral, they can't eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	O	6439	This algae is then eaten by zooxanthellae, which is then eaten by the corals.
EBA1415_TFBM_2_CB_ES-05559	O	6440	So no algae means no food.

EBA1415_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05013	R-3-50	6446	One of the things that causes differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the temperature of the water.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05013	O	6447	The temperature in the water rises, so the water needs to stay at a certain temperature rate.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05013	R-3-50	6448	If the temperature rate rises then the corals will die.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05013	O	6449	It needs to be between 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05013	O	6450	Another thing maybe cause coral bleaching is people who drop anchors.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_CB_ES-05013	O	6451	The anchors might hit the coral.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	R-1-3	6459	Coral can only live in a certain temperature, and trade winds shift every year, changing temperature.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	R-3-50	6460	When the temperature increases, the coral starts to die in the reefs.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	O	6461	This happened in 1998 when the water temperature, got out of hand, and 16% of the world's coral died. /
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	R-11-50	6462	Something else that can affect the rates of coral bleaching are extreme storms.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	O	6463	Corals are sensitive to how salty the water is.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	R-11-13	6464	When something extreme such as a hurricane or tropical storm hits, the amount of salt in the water decreases.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	O	6466	The final thing that can lead to differences in the rates of corl bleaching is the zooxanthelle/coral relationship.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	O	6467	These things both rely on eachother and enviromental stressors can threaten this relationship.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	O	6468	The zooxanthelle algae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but coral can get damaged by human activities such as blast fishing and tourists dropping anchors or walking on reefs.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	O	6469	When the coral is damaged, stress is put on the corals.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	R-6-7	6470	When the coral is stressed, they have to eject their food producing algae.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_CB_ES-05958	R-7-50	6471	Without the algae, coral because bleached and that negatively affects it's relationship with the zooxanthelle algae.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6522	Coral bleaching is a terrible thing that happens and causes coral to lose its color and turn completely white.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	R-7-50	6523	The cause of the coral bleaching is when the algae inside coral, zooxanthallae, dies.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6524	There are many things that cause zooxanthele to die but it is mostly physical damage to the coral itself.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6525	Physical damage is death to the coral by blast fishing and when sailors drop their boat's anchor directly on the coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6526	What happens when the coral turn white or "bleach" is the are left vulnerable to pollution, disease, and starvation. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6527	There are couple of reasons why coral bleaching varies in different areas.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6528	One huge reason is photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6529	Since zooxanthellae is algae it does require photosynthesis and to do so it must have a certain requirements.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	R-3-5	6530	First the water must be between 70-85 degrees F in order to perform photosynthesis. /
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6531	Second the salinity (how salty the water is) must be a specific amount.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	R-11-13	6532.1	The level of salinity can be altered by storm which being in fresh water lowering the salinity. /

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04785	O	6535	So next time your on the ocean remember do not pollute, alter the water temperature, and finally be careful where you place your anchor.  //
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-1-50	6536	One main reason Coral bleeching occurs at different rates is because of the trade winds.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-3-50	6537	The text supports this because they say coral die when the water temperature changes.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-1-3	6538	Ex, the graph shows that in 1998 the trade winds were at record breaking lows of it's strength.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-1-3	6539.1	this caused the water temperature to rise, thus causing coral bleaching records to be at it's highest record ever.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-3-50	6539.2	this caused the water temperature to rise, thus causing coral bleaching records to be at it's highest record ever.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-1-50	6540	This corresponds to the graph below it because it shows that coral bleaching was at it's most in 1998 due to trade winds./
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-13-50	6541	Another reason coral bleaching happens at different rates is because of the drop of salinity in the ocean.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	R-12-13	6542	Ocean salinity can drop if there is an excess amount of fresh water being raned into the ocean.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6543	In the text, it says that coral reefs canot survive if the salinity drops in the ocean.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6544	This can be another drastic phanomeanon killing coral reefs./
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6545	Lastly, coral reefs die each year due to human interactions.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6546	It says in the text, "that coral reefs die when humans step, throw anchors, and hunt coral reefs."
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6547	This shows that coral reefs can die from human interaction to. /
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6548	In conclusion, coral reefs are diminishing each year due to many causes.
EBA1415_RDJK_5_CB_ES-04725	O	6549	This can effect many other things in the ecosystem & creat a chain reaction.  //
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6550	Corals get there color by the different types of algae that live with the coral.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6551	And when corals lose their color they change to plain white.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6552	This is called coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6553	Coral bleaching can give the world serious problems if people cannon stop it from happening./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	R-1-3	6554	When there are weaker trade winds the water temp increases.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	R-1-3	6555	According to the graph in 1998 when the trade wind went down to -9.000 the water temp rose to about 2.500 and in the coral bleaching report of that year showed that there were 72 cases of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6556	While in the year 1997 the trade winds were at 2.000 the water temp was at -1.000 and the coral bleaching report of that year was 11 cases of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6557	Coral bleaching appears more in the Pacific Ocean because it contains double the amount of water than the Atlantic Ocean and usually coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical water because the algae, zooxanthellae needs light to use in photosynthesis to make energy plus the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6558	In the coral and photosynthesis article it states "Reef building coral need water temperatures between 70-85F. 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	R-3-4	6559	As water temperature increase, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in water decrease.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	R-4-14	6560	Change in the amount of CO2 threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy."
EBA1415_SWCT_7_CB-04888	O	6561	Coral bleach has different rates because many things can change the rate of coral bleach and thats why there aren't many cases of coral bleaching reaching 100+ reports.//

EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6580	Coral bleaching, or a phenomenon where healthy colorful coral becomes white in color, is an increasing issue in the scientific world in 1998, 162 of the worlds coral died due to coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6581	The rates of coral bleaching differ because of several reasons, one reasons is that due to natural disaters.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	R-11-50	6582	Disasters, such as heavy storms & hurricanes, are problems for coral.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6583	The massive amount of rain temporarily sets the amount of salt water off balance.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6584	Corals are highly sensitive to the amount of salt in the water.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6585	The storms cause a decrease, which is detrimental to coral health.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6586	Another reason are trade winds.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	R-1-50	6587	According to data collected from 1979-2008, weaker wind trade is a cause for higher coral bleaching reports.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	R-1-3	6588	From 1997-98, wind trade was almost at -10.000.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6589	Coral bleaching reports that year were over 70 countries that reported.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	R-1-3	6590	These winds interfere with water temperatures.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	R-3-4	6591	As the water heats up the amount of CO2 decreases.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6592	Corals neeed certain amounts of CO2 to stay healthy.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6593	the decrease in CO2 is a serious problem for the corals.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6594	Finally, tourists are another reason for rate changes.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6595	When we drop anchors or walk on the reefs, we cause damage physically.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05847	O	6596	Mainly though, changes in the corals environment are detramental.

EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05097	R-1-50	6619	In addition, Trade winds could affect the color of the corals.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05097	O	6620	The pacific trade winds travel from east to west.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05097	R-1-2	6621	The winds drag warm surface water westward.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6627	Looking at the graph of Trade Winds and coral bleaching it helps show what leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-1-50	6628	As trade winds get weaker The severity of coral bleaching reports per year becomes worse.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-1-50	6629.1	In 1998 trade winds got severly weaker going down to -8.000 and more and the water temperature went up more than 5 degrees.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-3-50	6629.2	In 1998 trade winds got severly weaker going down to -8.000 and more and the water temperature went up more than 5 degrees.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-3-50	6630.2	As a result in that same year Coral Bleaching reports come out to being more than 70 reports.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-1-50	6631	Weakers trade winds are causing coral bleaching to rise.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6632	The reason trade winds have such a impact is because corals are made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6633	Polyps created corals around from us a protection barrier.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6634	Coral reefs need CO2 from the photosynthesis the polyps go through to recicve energy to give to the coral which they need 50% to 95% of.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-1-3	6635.1	The process is very sensitive to changes in enviroment so if the trade winds change the temperature in the water the photosynthesis will change, and become uncomplete.

EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6637	Though there is a extra detail in this.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	R-5-50	6638	If the algae called zooxanthe cannot complete photosynthesis they won't be able to give the coral it's color.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6639	The algae rely on the coral to stay healthy, just like the corals defend on the alge for their colors.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05393	O	6640	Coral bleaching is one example of how environment stressors (weak trade winds can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae. //
EBA1415_TWDG_11_CB_ES-06202	O	6641	According to the passage I recently read what leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching are in order to build coral.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_CB_ES-06202	R-3-5	6642	Corals need water temperatures between 70-85oF because the process or photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_CB_ES-06202	O	6643	Their balance can also be threatened by extreme storms.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_CB_ES-06202	R-14-50	6644.1	Coral bleaching is one example of how enviromental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06147	O	6647	What leads to coral bleaching is a problem with an imapct on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06147	O	6648	Coral is mistaken for a rock or plant.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06147	O	6649	Coral are made up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06147	O	6650	Corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyps.
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04856	O	6651	What leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching?
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04856	O	6652	First of all you'll need to know coral bleaching is. 
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04856	O	6653	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in wich coral loses its color and turns plain white. 
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04856	R-7-50	6654	Corals turn white due to ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae. 
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04856	O	6655	Algae is very helpful to the coral, it provides a protected nutrient-rich environment for the algae, the algae also provides the coral with their colors. 
EBA1415_SWSP_4_CB_ES-04856	R-7-50	6656	So basically without zooxanthellae algae cannot make their colors and they will be bleached.  //
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05062	O	6657	I learn that coal bleaching is in the ocean and It looseing it color to all white that why it call coal bleaching.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_CB_ES-05062	R-1-50	6658	Coal bleaching is affecting the ocean all of the coal in the ocean is turning white the current of the water is shifting all type of direction that why all of coral is white.  //
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-1-50	6659	Certain things that can lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching include trade winds.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	O	6660	Coral reefs need 70-85 degrees F water tempertures, in order to survive.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-1-2	6661	When trade winds occur, the winds drag warm surface water's westward.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-3-5	6662	This can harm the process of photosynthesis due to the changing water.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-1-3	6663	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean, and trade winds causes central & eastern Pacific regions to have a temperature as low as 3 degree F to 5 degree F.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-3-50	6664	This can harm coral reefs process and cause them to bleach due to the low temperatures.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-1-6	6665.1	Changes in the environment, like trade winds, can put stress on coral and can cause corals to eject their food producing algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-6-7	6665.2	Changes in the environment, like trade winds, can put stress on coral and can cause corals to eject their food producing algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-7-50	6666	If algae isn't produced, coral reef's cannot get color, & eventually turn white.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-13-50	6667	Another thing that can lead to coral bleaching is ocean salinity (how salty the ocean is).
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-11-13	6668.1	Whenever there is some type of storm, hurricane, etc...the salinity in the water decreases, and these storms can increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes the saltiness to stop.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-11-12	6668.2	Whenever there is some type of storm, hurricane, etc...the salinity in the water decreases, and these storms can increase the amount of fresh water in the ocean, which causes the saltiness to stop.

EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	O	6669	So when there are storms, corals can have their water refreshed & corals can have a better chance in keeping their color in tact.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	O	6670	Something that can impact corals in a negative way is blast fishing, tourists who drop ancors of walk on reefs.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-6-7	6671	Coral reefs are very sensative, so when outside forces come in, the increased stress on corals from the enviornment forces the coral to eject their food producing algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	R-7-50	6672	When algae isn't produced, corals cannot maintian having their color, and this is how some of the corals become bleached.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04758	O	6673	In conclusion, there are many things that can lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.  //
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB_ES-04796	O	6674	What leads to differences in the rate of coral bleaching?

EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05382	R-6-50	6761	Something that leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching are because of the environment, when the climate and weather changes, or when the environment stressors affect the coral and zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05382	R-7-50	6762	Also when the coral is rejected or what the zooxanthellae does, it cause the coral to change white.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05382	R-1-3	6763	According to the graphs, the lower the trade wind strength the higher the water tempereatures.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-05382	O	6764	Also, over the years, coral bleaching has been getting more and more severe, especially  in the years 1987, and 1998.

EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05366	O	6767	There are many ways that can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05366	R-1-50	6768	One way is shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05366	R-1-50	6769.1	This can cause coral bleaching because coral reef needs the water temperature to be between 70-85 degrees F for the process of photosynthesis, and when trade winds shift it will change the water temp. by increasing by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F and sometimes 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05366	R-3-5	6769.2	This can cause coral bleaching because coral reef needs the water temperature to be between 70-85 degrees F for the process of photosynthesis, and when trade winds shift it will change the water temp. by increasing by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F and sometimes 10 degrees F.

EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05342	O	6775	The environment around the coral can cause different rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05342	O	6776	For example, the temperature of the water the coral is living in corals can survive in temperatures as low as 70 degrees F and so high as 85 degrees F.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_CB_ES-05342	O	6777	This is due to the process of photosynthesis being so sensitive to changes in the ocean.

EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05100	R-1-3	6793	This shows that water temperature changes when the winds change.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05100	R-3-5	6794	Coral & Photosynthesis states, "Reef building corals need water temperatures below 70-85 degrees F because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive changes in water."
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05100	R-1-3	6795	This shows that coral reefs are sensitive to changes in water temperatures and the trade winds are altered the water temperatures becomes higher than what is needs to be for the coral.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05100	R-14-50	6796.1	Coral and zooxanthallae states, "Coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae.

EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	O	6843	In 1997, when this happened, the following year there was a huge outbreak in coral bleaching leading to US to lose 16% of our coral reefs.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	R-11-50	6844	To add to that, storms, such as hurricanes, also may be causing coral bleaching.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	R-11-13	6845.1	When there is a tropical storm, the salt level in the ocean is lowered due to all the fresh water entering.

EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	O	6846	This greatly affects the coral's environments, damaging the coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	O	6847	Lastly, during coral bleaching, not only does the animal lose color, but it loses energy and protection.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	O	6848	How will the coral get energy without food in the first place though?
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB_ES-04764	O	6849	If there is not enough sunlight, oxygen, CO2, or more in the water, coral cannot produce energy. /

EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6851	Coral Bleachoing is a phenomenon in which corals lose their color.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6852	Corals get their color from a type of algae called zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6853	This algae not only gives the coral its color, but also some of its food produced by photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6854	In return, the coral gives zooxanthellae a protected nutirent-rich enviornment where it can perform photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6855	Zooxanthellae need corals to live inside of because there are not enough photosynthesis in the tropical ocean to allow photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6856	The algae rely on the the coral to stay healthy, however when the coral sustain damage it ejects the algae.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	R-7-50	6857	Coral bleaching happens because the zooxanthellae are no longer there to give the coral its color.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	R-1-50	6858	Another effect of coral bleaching is shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	R-1-3	6859	This is because when trade winds shift, water tempertures can increase more than 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	R-1-3	6860	When trade winds weaken water temperatures have been a lot higher.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6861	In the year 1998, trade winds were very weak and the water temperature rose.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_CB-04769	O	6862	Also that year, severe coral bleaching reports greatly increased.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05597	R-1-50	6892.1	This will lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching because if the trade wind strength is very strong the water temperature will increase by 3 degrees F, 5 degrees F, or even 10 degrees F, and this affects the coral because as water temperatures increase, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) increases leading to threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05597	R-1-3	6892.2	This will lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching because if the trade wind strength is very strong the water temperature will increase by 3 degrees F, 5 degrees F, or even 10 degrees F, and this affects the coral because as water temperatures increase, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) increases leading to threaten the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05597	R-3-50	6893.1	The water temperature also leads to differences in the rate of coral bleaching because if the Carbon Dioxide is imbalanced (due to weather), there is a threat of extreme storms.

EBA1415_ERAM_1_CB_ES-04957	R-1-2	6928	Upwelling is when winds drag warm surface waters westard. 
EBA1415_ERAM_1_CB_ES-04957	R-3-50	6929	Upwelling in the eastern Pacific Ocean causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western Pacific Ocean. 
EBA1415_ERAM_1_CB_ES-04957	R-3-50	6930	This causes the coral to lose its color, because it needs to be a certain temperature for the coral to be healthy.
EBA1415_ERAM_1_CB_ES-04957	R-7-50	6931	The most dangerous threats to the health of corals are caused by changes in their environment when this happens, the coral ejects their food-producing algae, causing the bleaching to begin.

EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05646	R-4-50	6963	Another reason as to why coral bleaching occurs is because of the inbalance of water and CO2.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05646	R-4-5B	6964	Sometimes when the winds are really strong it will cause the sea level to rise, meaning that there's more water than CO2, and CO2 is what gives the coral their energy in order to stay healthy. /

EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	R-2-1	6974.1	Trade winds are wind forces that drag warm water westward, but every few years, they can be altered, leading weakening in the winds or complete directional changes, pushing warm water eastward.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	R-1-2	6974.2	Trade winds are wind forces that drag warm water westward, but every few years, they can be altered, leading weakening in the winds or complete directional changes, pushing warm water eastward.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	O	6975	The trade winds and coral bleaching document shows two graphs.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	R-1-3	6976	One showing trade wind force and water temperature, and the other showing coral bleaching reports.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	O	6977	In 1998, figure shows that the trades winds got weaker and the water temperature went up.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	O	6978	Figure B shows that 73 coral bleachings were reported in 1998.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	R-1-50	6979	So weaker trade winds lead to more coral bleachin gs.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_CB_ES-05846	R-3-4	6980	Well technically, the carbon decrease in the ocean because of warm teperatures, which is needed by the algae they house to follow the procedure of photosynthesis.

EBA1415_TWPK_1_CB_ES-05041	R-6-50	6983	Coral Bleaching is Phenomena because it is severe and the coral are losing their beautiful color and are turning white or Bleached.
EBA1415_TWPK_1_CB_ES-05041	R-6-50	6984	What causes this is stress because people drop ankors on coral or people step on it and its affecting the corals life style.
EBA1415_TWPK_1_CB_ES-05041	R-6-5B	6985	When coral get stressed they release their food and it turns into algae.
EBA1415_TWPK_1_CB_ES-05041	O	6986	Coral is made up of a polyp A coral polyp has a saclike body and they use limestone to make a hard skeleton.
EBA1415_TWPK_1_CB_ES-05041	O	6987	The coral is made of the polyps skeleton ad the coral needs things to survive but if its interupted it will probably Die or it might get stressed.  //

EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	O	6989	Coral is mostly in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	O	6990	Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow tropical waters.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	O	6991	Zooxanthellae live in the coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	R-4-5	6992	When photosynthesis is happening,; zooxanthellae use energy from sunlight to combine carbon dioxide in the ocean with water.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	O	6993	This results in the combination of sugar and oxygen while it is occuring.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	O	6994	Carbon passed from algae to the coral in the form of glucose.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	R-4-5	6995	If there is sun light and a normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo the photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	R-1-2	6996	Trade winds weaken or revers direction completely to blow from west to East.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	R-1-2	6997	When this happens, under it warm surface waters are dragged eastward towards South America.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05126	O	6998	Coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the corals and zooxanthellae.  //
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	6999	Coral bleaching has become a very deadly epidemic among the ocean's corals.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7000	However, how does this happen?
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7001	Coral bleaching is when a coral loses its color.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7002	There is several explanations on why a coral is to lose their color.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7003	Coral bleaching can cause very dramatic impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7004	Also, coral bleaching can be considered as the death of coral, moreover, there is yet more to explain. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-1-50	7005	Coral bleaching can be caused by multiple reasons.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-1-50	7006	Moreover, this can occur due to shifting trdade winds.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-1-3	7007	When trade winds are altered, they happen to increase temperature by the equator.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-1-3	7008	Due to other research, corals are to be in 70-85 degrees F, but the trade winds might increase it very majorly.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7009	However, corals need sunshine for photosynthesis, therefore, it can be known as a debatable reason. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7010	Rising temperature may not be the only reason to the coral epidemic.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7011	What if the inside of a coral, can be its own death?
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7012	Algae are in a great relationship with corals. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7013	They benefit each other.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7014	However, a coral is to protect the algae, but sometimes its impossible.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7015	When the algae isn't able to get its proper nutrients, it dies.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7016	Once the algae dies, the coral doesn't get its own nutrients which eventually leads to its death.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	O	7017	Once it's dying, it bleaches. /
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-3-50	7018.1	From rising temperatures, and dead algae, nature itself can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-7-50	7018.2	From rising temperatures, and dead algae, nature itself can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_CB_ES-05404	R-11-14	7019	When nature's powerful forces occur, such as tornadoes, hurricane, etc corals can't stay health.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	O	7023	When coral bleaching occurs the coral basically "loses it color."
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	R-7-50	7024	Some things that make coral bleaching occur would be 'Zooxanthellae', an algae dying because it supports the corals health and color.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	R-7-50	7025	If the algae died the coral will become unhealthy which leads to the color loss.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	O	7026	Some dying coral do recover, however it not often.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	O	7027	Reef building coral needs a certain amount of temperature in the water which is "70-85F."
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	O	7028	Also, salinity is needed, another rate that causes coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	R-13-14	7029	If salinity isn't high it upsets the abalnce necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_CB_ES-05591	R-11-13	7030.1	If the water gets hit by a storm, that causes excessive rainfall, which causes the salinity to drop because of fresh water in the ocean.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04773	O	7036	The coral gets most of its food from a type of algae witch the coral is providing food for it.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04773	O	7037	The algae needs CO2 and sunlight to do photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04773	O	7038	If all is well then the algae produces glucose for the coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04773	R-4-5B	7039.1	When there is not enough CO2 however the algae can't make the glucose any more so the coral kicks them out, and since the algae is what gives the coral its color it turns white.

EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04773	R-1-4	7040	The reason for the drops in CO2 is because of the Trade Winds.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB_ES-04773	R-1-3	7041.1	When there is a weeker trades are always getting weeker and stronger, but sometimes the trades drop to dangerously week levels making the water get to warm for CO2 to be around.

EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7096	Coral live in colonies, where there are many polyps.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7097	The skeleton protect the delicate body of the polyps.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7098	This is partly call zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7099	Zooxanthellae use energy from sunlight.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	R-4-5	7100	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7101	Scientists estimate that corals receive 50% to 95% of their energy from this process.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7102	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7103	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7104	Coral bleaching is a serious prolem.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_CB_ES-04815	O	7105	Coral are most in Asia, Papua New Guinea and North America the most dangerous threats to the healthof corouls are those that are caused by changes in their environment that put stress on coral.  //
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	R-1-50	7106	The difference in rates of coral bleaching are caused by shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	O	7107	Shifting trade winds are the winds go from blowing east to west to west to east.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	R-1-2	7108	The winds usall path causes warm water to be pushed to the west and with the change the warm water areas get cold and the cold water place gets warm.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	R-1-50	7109	Data shows that whenthe winds get weaker that coral bleaching occurs.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	R-3-4	7110	"As the temperature increases, the amount of CO2 in the water decreases," Coral & Photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	R-5-5B	7111	The zooxanthellae, that live in the coral, goes through photosynthesis and passes the sugar the make throughout the coral.
EBA1415_SDMK_6_CB-04783	O	7112	Also the salinity affects the process. //
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	O	7113	Coral needs zooxanthellae algae to survive.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	O	7114	They both help each other out by coral to produce a protect nutrient-rich enviroment for the algae.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	O	7115	The algae then gains food through photosynthesis and the algae shares some of it food to the coral benefiting each other.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	O	7116	But, this can be disrupted if the trade winds are altered.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-1-2	7117	The trade winds help the western pacific to be warmer than the eastern pacific.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-1-4	7118	Every few years, the trade winds are altered making them weaker or reverse the directions completely.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-1-4	7119.1	This causes the cliamte to change making the amount of carbon dioxide (Co2) in water to decrease.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-4-14	7119.2	This causes the cliamte to change making the amount of carbon dioxide (Co2) in water to decrease.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-14-50	7120.1	This threatens coral because the algae wouldn't make as much food as it use to.

EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-7-50	7122.2	And because of this, the corals becomes unhealthy and causes either the algae to die, or the coral to eject the algae by force.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-7-50	7123	As soon as that happens, corals begin to loss their color making them looked bleached.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_CB_ES-06063	R-14-50	7124	This what causes coral to bleach.//
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	R-7-50	7125	Coral bleaching is bad.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	R-7-50	7126	It is when the coral has ejected the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	O	7127	A zooxanthellae is an organism that helps the coral get nutrients.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	O	7128	The coral also provides safety and nutrients for the zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	O	7129	When the enviorment changes, it is dangerous  for the coral.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	R-1-3	7130	Like in 1998 when the trade winds shifted or slowed down, it caused warm waters to become cold and cold waters to become warm.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	O	7131	This drastic change in enviorment caused the bleaching which killed 16% of the worlds coral reefs.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	O	7132	But when the water went back to normal as well as the wind, the coral death rate went down.
EBA1415_TWMD_45_CB_ES-04997	O	7133	So when there is enviorment change then you can also expect the coral to bleach and die.  //
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7134	There are multiple things that lead up to coral bleaching./
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7135	First the eastern inward wind are messing up the temperature.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7136	Coral has to do photosynthesis for their energy.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7137	In order to do photosynthesis you need the water to be a certain tempertaure.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7138	The winds are knocking off the tempertaure by as up to 10o.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	R-1-50	7139	The winds are messing with the corals energy so it bleaches./
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	R-1-13	7140.1	Next the winds are also messing the amount of salt in the water which makes the coral white.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	R-13-50	7140.2	Next the winds are also messing the amount of salt in the water which makes the coral white.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	R-1-2	7141	The winds are messing up the rotation of the water which evaporates the salt in the water.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	R-13-50	7142	With less salt the water get's less dense and makes coral turn white./
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7143	Finally, the human interactions on the coral reefs are messing up the relationship between the algae and the coral.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_CB_ES-05091	O	7144	When humans drop anchors from their boat, it lands on a coral and does physical damage to the coral when the algae needs it healthy.//

EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7233	Another thing that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleching and perhaps the biggest is the environment.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7234	Basically, in order for Coral reefs to survive they need photosynthesis.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7235	In the article titled coral & photosynthesis it states that scientists estimate that corals receive 50%-95% of their energy from this process.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	R-3-5	7236	It all states that in order for this to happen the temperature of the water has to be between 70-85oF because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temperature.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	R-2-3	7237	In the shifting wind article it states that "when surface water shifts eastward ocean water Temperature can increase by 3o-5oF".
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7238	In some places over 10oF above the customary range.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7239	So say the water temperature is 84oF by the coral reef and the water shifts and increase the water temp by 5oF.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	R-3-5	7240.1	Then the temperature is 89oF is to not for photosynthesis to take places and coral bletching takes place because the coral doesn't get the energy it needs to survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	R-5-50	7240.2	Then the temperature is 89oF is to not for photosynthesis to take places and coral bletching takes place because the coral doesn't get the energy it needs to survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	R-5B-50	7240.3	Then the temperature is 89oF is to not for photosynthesis to take places and coral bletching takes place because the coral doesn't get the energy it needs to survive.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7241	Say this happens a lot then a lot of coral bletching takes place and a lot of reefs will die.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7242	This is another reason why there is a difference in the rates./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7243	There are many different thing's that can lead to differences in rates  of coral bletching.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7244	Those things include as people and the environment itself.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_CB_ES-05177	O	7245	Some of these difference cant really be stopped so we must enjoy the coral reefs for as long as we can.//
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7246	There are many leads to differences in the rates if coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7247	The first piece of evidence is "stress can negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae," (HSA_2014).
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7248	This shows the rate of coral bleaching because with the relationship they both can't live without each other.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7249	The algae gives coral food in which it lives and also the algae gives it color.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7250	It would turn white because the supply are making a lot and put down everything in which the coral is getting a disease.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7251	That how alot of coral reefs start deing and soon there will be no coral ans the sea animals would die.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	R-7-50	7252	The second pieces of example is "the corals turn white due to ejection of zooxanthellae."
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7253	This show the effects because it will turn white and the coral some times can't relive it's self and jsut stay there to die.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7254	The coral is usede as a home/ poctection for smal other animals like fish from bigger animals like sherks, big fish, carbs, etc...
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7255	The third example is "The Zooxanthellae pass some of the food they make from the sun's energy to the coral.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7256	The algae also provide corals with their colors."
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7257	This shows the effects because they can't live without it, the coral polyps also give it's there color.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7258	Coral needs alll that thing or it will turn white and sometimes die.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7259	They need to be pretoction or sun there will be no more and the coral will be harder to learn about.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05648	O	7260	That is about the rates and the coral bleaching, so be sure to help keep them soft. //
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB-04712	O	7261	There are different ways that coral bleaching can happen.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB-04712	O	7262	The shifting of trade winds which could move the coral around to different places.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_CB-04712	O	7263	In 1998, thr coral bleaching grew worse reaching 72 percent. //
EBA1415_LVSN_7_CB_ES-05906	R-3-50	7264	The changes in temperature and human activity affect the differences in coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_CB_ES-05906	R-1-2	7265	In the reading "coral and photosynthesis", it says corals are sensitive to temperature change during photsyntheis but the trade winds change directions and cause warm waters to be in a different place then they are suppose to be.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_CB_ES-05906	O	7266	Theese changes cause zooxanthallae, an algae that grows along with the coral, to die When the coral takes to much physical damage.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_CB_ES-05906	R-6-7	7267	A coral gets damaged when humans start touring and drop anchors or go blast fishing, this puts stress on the coral and the coral will start to eject the algea, zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_LVSN_7_CB_ES-05906	R-7-50	7268	The coral and algea have a symbolic relationship which means they both benifit from each other, the coral protects the algae and the algae provides nutrients, and as the algae dies nutirents wont be provided for the coral which causes the bleaching process.//
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	O	7269	Things that lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the weather and the place that hey are located in.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	O	7270	This is important because in a picture it shows the Pacific Oceans and it's places affected.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	O	7271	For example towards Asia and Australia there was a little bit more coral bleaching, at least that is how the pictures shows it. /
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	O	7272	Another difference that leads to rates of coral bleaching is weather.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	R-11-13	7273	According to coral & photosynthesis as it states that "sality can decrease in shallow coastal regions during storms that cause excessive rainfal, hurricanes or tropical storms." (EPA, 4).
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	R-11-50	7274	This shows that how the rainfall is salty and is there is a lot of hurricanes and storms it will affect the life of the coral.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05679	O	7275	I am aware that coral bleaching is being caused by the place (location) & the weather. 	Ran out of time //
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7276	The are two major things that lead to the differneces in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7277	First is shifting trade winds, and what happens to the algae in the coral.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7278	In the article, it stated, "every few years, trade winds are altered.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7279	The trade winds weaken weaken or reverese direction completely to blow from west to east.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7280	Warm surface waters are dragged eastward towards South America."
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7281	As a result, it causes central and eastern Pacific  regions to swell.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7282	Sea level rises quickly and constantly.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-3-50	7283	With these shifts, temperature's of warm water increase by 3-5 degrees F.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7284	In someplaces 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-3-50	7285	This relates with coral bleaching because, in coral reefs algae lives in it.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7286	Actually a specific algae called zooxanthellae needs that coral to survive.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7287	Zooxanthellae lives in warm tropical water.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7288	Corals need that algae to give them color and to survive.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-1-50	7289.1	If the Shifting trade winds make colors the corals will die and cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-50-50	7289.2	If the Shifting trade winds make colors the corals will die and cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7290	Sooner or later the coral will die too.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7291	Corals have contact with the sun and algae needs sunlight to process photosynthesis.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	O	7292	Also if the water is colder that normal the amount of carbon dioxide algae creates after photosynthesis decreases which affects the corals health.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-1-50	7293.1	Once again, coral bleaching starts with trade winds shifting.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-1-3	7293.2	Once again, coral bleaching starts with trade winds shifting.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-1-3	7294.1	Those winds cause water temperature to change cause the algae to die which affects corals to turn white. //
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-3-7	7294.2	Those winds cause water temperature to change cause the algae to die which affects corals to turn white. //
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05204	R-7-50	7294.3	Those winds cause water temperature to change cause the algae to die which affects corals to turn white. //
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	O	7295	Coral bleaching can occur at different rates.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	O	7296	The main cause for there differences are trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-7-50	7297.1	Coral bleaching can be caused by a change in their environment because it puts stress on the coral, making it eject the zooxanthallae algae.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-6-7	7297.2	Coral bleaching can be caused by a change in their environment because it puts stress on the coral, making it eject the zooxanthallae algae.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	O	7298	Trade winds are very important, as they can change the climate and temperature of the water.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-1-2	7299	The wind can change direction, which causes warm surface waters to move location.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-3-4	7300.1	An increase in water temperature causes CO2 levels to decrease which affects the algaes photosynthesis process.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-4-5	7300.2	An increase in water temperature causes CO2 levels to decrease which affects the algaes photosynthesis process.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-5-14	7300.3	An increase in water temperature causes CO2 levels to decrease which affects the algaes photosynthesis process.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-5-14	7301	The corals health is then unbalanced.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-13-14	7302	Another variable is salinity, as it can upset the balance of the coral when it drops.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-6-7	7303	Because corals rely on algae to get energy anf stay healthy, when an enviromental stressor affects the coral it forcefully ejects the algae thus unable to sustain itself and dies.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-1-3	7304.1	One of the major impacts to coral reefs happened in 1998, when weaker trade winds caused the water temp to go up, causing CO2 to drop and kiling the coral.  //
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05426	R-3-50	7304.2	One of the major impacts to coral reefs happened in 1998, when weaker trade winds caused the water temp to go up, causing CO2 to drop and kiling the coral.  //

EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7305	The things that leads to diffrences in the rate of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7306	Is because sometimes coral is mistaken for a rock or plant./
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7307	Also the changes in water tempature can effect the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7308	Corals are sensitive to ocean salinity (how salty the water is)./
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7309	Coral and zooxanthallae alge have a symbiotic relationship.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	R-7-50	7310	So if zooxanthellae goes missing their will be no coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7311	The algae also provides the coral with its colors.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7312	However, certain enviormental stressors can threaten this relationship.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	O	7313	Other examples that lead to differences in the rates of coral bleaching include blast fishing and tourist who drop anchors or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	R-14-6	7314	The most dangerous threats to the health of coral are those are caused by changes in the enviorment.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB_ES-06154	R-14-6	7315	That put stress on corals.//
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05166	O	7316	Marine biologists have discovered many different types of corals living in the oceans, Different types of algae give the corals their colors.

EBA1415_ERSK_1_CB_ES-05783	O	7324	What leads to coral bleaching maybe 2 reasons. 
EBA1415_ERSK_1_CB_ES-05783	R-1-3	7325	Number one the weaker the wind is the higher the temperature of the water is. 
EBA1415_ERSK_1_CB_ES-05783	O	7326	Number 2 environmental stressor make corals to eject their food-producing algae that makes them more vunerable to starvation and death. 
EBA1415_ERSK_1_CB_ES-05783	O	7327	Also humans have part on this for example blast fishing, tourist dropping anchors, and walking on reefs. 
EBA1415_ERSK_1_CB_ES-05783	O	7328	Based on shifting Trade winds what I understood was that the water of the pacific ocean is cold not hot. 
EBA1415_ERSK_1_CB_ES-05783	R-1-3	7329.1	Also on water temperature v.s trade wind I observed that The weaker the wind got the higher temperature got and more coral bleaching happened.//

EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	O	7330	The cause of coral bleaching is the things that live in there that's not doing their job.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	O	7331	Coral bleaching is most noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	O	7332	The trade winds in the western and eastern pacific probably messes up the things that's suppose to help the coral reefs.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	O	7333	The coral would be better off living in the western pacific because the eastern pacific causes major shifts in the world's climate.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	O	7334	Corals are very sensitive to changes in the environment.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	R-3-5	7335	Teh water temperatures as to stay between 70-85oF because the photosynthesis is sensitive to change water temperature.
EBA1415post_TWPK_3_CB_ES-05047	O	7336	Coral reefs need to be in clear, shallow, tropical waters.

EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05207	O	7349	But some of the waters are too cool like 3 to 10 degrees F.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05207	O	7350	Corals are also affected by storms because corals rely on the amounts of salt in the waters.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_CB_ES-05207	R-11-13	7351.1	So when it storms the water tempatures and levels of salt will be all mest up and bad for the coral.

EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05535	O	7510	Coral polyp range in size from tiny up to a foot in diameter.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05535	O	7511	Corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyps.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05535	O	7512	Polyps use limestones from seawater to build a hard skeleton.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05535	O	7513	That hard skeleton protects the delicate body of polyps, the hard skeleton build up and form coral reefs.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05535	O	7514	Coral reefs are only found in clear, shallow, tropical water.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05535	O	7515	Most coral bleaching is found in the pacific ocean, or noticeable.//
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	O	7516	The thing that leads to the differences in the rate of coral bleaching is that the coral each year rises about 10 times every 3 to 10 years.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	O	7517	The reason why they are becoming higher is because of the zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	O	7518	It's negatively affecting the balance between it and the corals.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	O	7519	The corals are really sensitive to changes of it's environments.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	R-7-50	7520	But they also die and get bleach when the zooxanthallae alge dies.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	R-3-50	7521	Another reason why the rate of coral bleaching to go up is because of the temp of the water and how much salt is in the water.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_CB-5610	O	7522	The water could be to cold for them to live in and the salt could be to high or to low to stay in too.//
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7523	Coral is rock or plant live creature make up of tiny animals called polyps.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7524	Coral relys on zooxanthellae, a type of algae, to stay alive in the same way that zooxanthellae depends on coral.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7525	Zooxanthellae provides coral with food.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7526	This food can only be produced in clear, shallow waters with a temperature between 70-85oF.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7527	Zooxanthellae provides coral with its color as well.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7528	The processes that zooxanthellae must go through to produce the coral's food and color is very sensitive to changes in water temperature.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	R-5-50	7529	If there is change in the environment, the zooxanthellae cannot go through its photosynthesis and the coral can not go through its photosynthesis and the coral will become malnurished and white.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	R-1-2	7530	Unfortunately, the alterations of trade winds majorly impacts the coral health because as trade winds drag all of the warm surface water away causing cold water from the bottom of the ocean to rise up creating cold temperatures prohibiting photosynthesis of zoxoanthallae.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	R-7-50	7531	When there is no living zooxanthallae in the coral, it becomes white from the lack of algae.
EBA1415_SDLC_2_CB_ES-04745	O	7532	This is commonly known as coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05709	O	7533	Coral reefs are found in circumtropical shallow tropical waters along the shores of islands and continents.
EBA1415_TRJA_11_CB_ES-05709	O	7534	The reef substrate is mainly composed of calcium carbonate from living and dead scleractinian corals with tight resource coupling plants live close association to the scleractinian corals with tight resource coupling and recycling, allowing coral reefs to have extremely high productivity and biodiversity such that they are referred to as the tropical rainforests of the ocean.//
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	O	7535	Coral bleaching results from many factors.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	O	7536	The first major reason, would be the shift in trade winds.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	O	7537	Normally, the phenomenon know as upwelling causes sea water in the east pacific to be cooler than the water in the west.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-1-2	7538	Every few years, the trade winds are reversed, sending warm water to the east, and cool water to the west.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-3-4	7539	This is an issue, as when there is warmer water, the amount of CO2 decreases.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-4-5	7540	Corals need CO2 and sunlight to undergo photosynthesis, and stay healthy.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	O	7541	Also, corals are very sensitive towards salinity.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-11-13	7542.1	When there are major storms, the amount of salt in the water can decrease.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-13-14	7542.2	When there are major storms, the amount of salt in the water can decrease.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-13-14	7543	This upsets the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-1-50	7544.1	During the years when the trade winds shift, or when there are major storms, the amount of bleached coral increase significantly.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-6-7	7545	In addition, increased stress on corals from the environment forces them to eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	O	7546	This can happen because of blast fishing or even because of tourists who drop anchors, or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_CB_ES-05522	R-1-50	7547.1	The shift in trade winds, lack of CO2, or even the death or ejection of the zooanthellae can cause corals to bleach. //

EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7558	Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7559	There are many ways that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7560	Allow me to explain how.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7561	There are many different types of corals living in the oceans but Pacific Ocean is where the coral bleaching is most noticeable.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7562	With these events leading to coral bleaching is a serious problem with a serious impact on our world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7563	Looking at the Coral Bleaching reports per. year, In 1998 almost over 70 countires had reported severe coral bleaching but in 1980 less than 10 had reported it.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_CB_ES-05534	O	7564	In different sources it states taht alot of people had often mistaken coral for an rock or plant.//
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05430	O	7565	A few things that cause coral bleaching are blast fishing, tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs, but most importantly is how their environment causes it.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05430	R-1-50	7566.1	Like, when the trade winds are low and and the water temperature is really high it causes coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05430	R-3-50	7566.2	Like, when the trade winds are low and and the water temperature is really high it causes coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05430	O	7567	Coral reefs need an average temperature of 70-85F, for the process of photosynthesis.

EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	O	7569	There are 2 significant reasons for the coral bleaching rates fluxuating.The first and major reason is the relationship between trade winds and water tempreture.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	R-1-3	7570	According to the first graph in the artical, "Trade Winds and Coral Bleaching", as the trade winds weaken, the tempreture of the water increases.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	R-1-3	7571	This contributes to the difference in rates because the coral needs to be a special tempreture to thrive and since the trade winds determine the tempreture, they also affect the coral.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	R-7-50	7572.1	The 2nd reason for the differences in coral bleaching rates is that when coral is under stress, it ejects its food producing algae.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	R-6-7	7572.2	The 2nd reason for the differences in coral bleaching rates is that when coral is under stress, it ejects its food producing algae.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	O	7573	This algae, zooxanthallae passes on food they make through photosynthesis to the coral.
EBA1415post_WSKT_1_CB_ES-05319	O	7574	These algae also give the coral its color.//
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	O	7575	There are many different reasons for the rate of coral reching to increase.

EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	O	7577	One of the reasons is because of trade winds.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	O	7578	Trade winds usually go from east to west.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	O	7579	After a few years the trade winds weaken or switch direction.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	O	7580	This causes different places.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	O	7581	That may affect the rate of coral bleaching to go up or down.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	R-3-50	7582	Usually, the higher the temperature, the more coral bleaching there are.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB_ES-05102	R-1-3	7583	So when there is weaker wind trades, there's higher temperaures, and more coral bleaching. /

EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05686	O	7713	Meaning it can take warm water and send it to the pacific, leaving it warm when it's usually cold.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05686	O	7714	Due to wind upwelling also happens to the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05686	O	7715	According to the Article "Shifting Trade Winds" the definition of upwelling is "it causes a surface waters to be colder than what its regular temperature it is".
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05686	O	7716	The pacific ocean goes from low to high temperatures in the water.
EBA1415_KYLS_6_CB_ES-05686	O	7717	In the "coral and zooxanthellae" article it said "However, the most dangerous threats to the health of corals are those that are caused by changes in their environment that put stress on coral".

EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7730	From the information I have gathered by reading about coral bleching and studying data on that subject, is that different causes are causing bleaching of the coral.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7731	Now that's pretty obvious, right?
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7732	But one of the main causes is shifting winds.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7733	Shifting winds or trade winds are altered every couple of years, causing them to be weakened or reversed completely to blow from west to east instead of east to west.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7734	By going in the opposite direction; it causes the Central and Eastern Pacific regions to swell, thus causing sea levels to rise from mere inches to as much as a foot.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7735	This causes a major change in the worlds climate which makes corals enviroment change, forcing it to change white (bleaching)./
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7736	There are many more ways to cause coral bleaching and out of those causes; the rates differ.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_CB_ES-05090	O	7737	So what I believe that leads to the differences in the rates of coral bleaching is the location, the amount of water, the possible threats and the algae. //
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	O	7738	Stated in the background "Coral Bleaching" is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color and turns white.

EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	O	7740	Coral needs to stay between 70-85 degrees F for the coral to remain healthy.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	R-3-4	7741	As water temperature increases, the amount of Carbon Dioxide in the water decreases.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	R-4-14	7742	The changes of CO2 can threaten the health of the coral.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	O	7743	Some things that can happen to coral that may lead to "Coral Bleaching" are blast fishing and that means tourists will drop anchors or walk on reefs.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	O	7744	The most dangerous threat to coral is the changes caused by the enviroment.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	R-6-7	7745	Because increased stress that the corals would carry, the coral may eject their food-producing algae.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_CB-05104	R-7-50	7746	With changes in enviroment means starvation for the coral because their food-producing algae would be gone, starvation being a leading cause of coral bleaching., could be said that enviromental changes are a leading cause of coral bleaching. //
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-06050	O	7747	The thing that leads to differences in the rates of coral bleaching are the different environment they're in.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-06050	O	7748	And the different relationships they have.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-06050	O	7749	"They can have negatively affect the balanced relationship between the coral zooxanthellae.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-06050	R-7-50	7750	During the bleaching, corals turned white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.

EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05764	O	7790	In the western pacific, the sea level declines as the warm surface water increasingly flows towards the east.
EBA1415_LVAH_2_CB_ES-05764	R-2-3	7791	Normally water temperature in these regions is 70-80 degrees; however, when surface waters shift eastward, ocean water temperatures increase by 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F.//
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05161	O	7792	Coral bleaching can be very affective on corals.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05161	O	7793	The color looks different Things can change.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05161	O	7794	There are many types of corals, corals are little animals in a colony They Tend To stay in one place.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05161	R-1-50	7795	If the wind strength weakens the more sevre coral bleaching is.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_CB_ES-05161	O	7796	for example in 1997-1998 the wind strength lowered to almost  -10.000 and the coral bleaching rised to almost 75 reports. //
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	O	7797	According to the document coral bleaching is "A phenomenon in which coral loses its color."
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	O	7798	Many events leading to coral bleaching can cause dangerous events to the worlds oceans/waters.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	R-1-50	7799	Events like "Trade Winds" can can play a role on Coral bleaching Trade Winds (the movement of winds in specific/reverse directions) can cause coral bleaching.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	O	7800	Such as when the wind pushes diffrent (colder or warmer) climates in certain areas can cause diffrent regions to swell.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	O	7801	Another factor that can lead to coral bleaching is the symbotic relationship of alge and coral.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	R-6-14	7802	There symbotic relationship (mutualism) can be dangerous because envirnomental stressors can negatavly affect the balanced relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae (alage).
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	R-6-50	7803	Coral bleaching is one example of an envirnmental stressor.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	R-7-50	7804	"Durning bleaching, corals turn white due to ejection or death of zooxanthellae algea".
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	O	7805	This can lead to the coral being exposed to diseases and starvation.
EBA1415post_WSAL_2_CB_ES-05364	O	7806	Those are some factors that can lead to coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	O	7807	There are multiple factors that lead to the rates of coral bleaching to change.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	O	7808	One of these factors is trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	R-1-3	7809	Every few years trade wind will slow down or reverse which changes the water temperature by 3 degrees up to 10 degrees.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	O	7810	This is a problem because coral reefs need the water to be a certin temperature.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	O	7811	Another factor that changes the rate is water salinity.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	R-11-13	7812	During rain storms that make alot of rain it might decrease the ocean salinity levels and hurt the corals.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05421	O	7813	The last factor that might change bleaching rate is physical damage. Some examples are anchors, people walking on them blast fishing. //
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	O	7814	Differences in the rates of coral bleachign are caused by multiple reasons.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	O	7815	Changes in their enviorment is one cause.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	R-3-50	7816	"Upwelling in the eastern pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific," (source 1) seeing that most coral bleaching happens in the Pacific, we can conclude that temperature change is a cause for the rate of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	O	7817	Another cause is Co2 loss.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	R-4-50	7818	Co2 loss can cause problems for the coral because it is a big change in the enviorment.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	R-11-13	7819.1	Corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity, if a storm or hurricane happened it could cause the salinity to drop wich would upset the balence necessary for the coral's health.

EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	R-6-50	7820	Stress is another cause for coral bleaching.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	O	7821	Stress can cause a negitive affect between coral and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05129	R-7-50	7822	Without a balence between the two, the corals may turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae alge, wich causes the corals to become vulnerable to disease and starvation wich will eventually cause coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05572	O	7823	The part of coral called "zooanthellae" are not getting sunlight.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05572	R-5-50	7824	And if they don't get or much sunlight they start to losse their color.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05572	O	7825	The reason why is because the "zooanthellae." if not getting mixed up with carbon dioxide./
EBA1415_AEKD_4_CB_ES-05572	O	7826	The coral also need special water temperturt because they are sincitive.

EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06181	O	7843	So when they die corals are vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06181	O	7844	Secondly reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85oF.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06181	O	7845	But when surface waters shift eastward.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06181	O	7846	Ocean water temperatures increase by 3oF to 5oF.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_CB_ES-06181	O	7847	What also effects corals is the death of zooxanthallae algae.

EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05672	R-3-50	7863	Based on the graphs, I inferres that water temperature increasing may be one of the cuses of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05672	O	7864	During th years with more rhan 20 number of countries reporting coral bleaching water temperatures also increased by at least one degree.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05672	R-1-3	7865.1	The reason for this may have to do with trade wind as the wind draw in cooler water to stablize the water temperature but as trade wind are weaker the water may be warmer than usual and cause the corals to panic therefore ejction the zooxanthallae and it lose its color as wella s source of food as the zooxanthallae helps corals make food by a process call photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05672	R-3-7	7865.2	The reason for this may have to do with trade wind as the wind draw in cooler water to stablize the water temperature but as trade wind are weaker the water may be warmer than usual and cause the corals to panic therefore ejction the zooxanthallae and it lose its color as wella s source of food as the zooxanthallae helps corals make food by a process call photosynthesis.

EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05672	O	7866	Without food the corals become vulnerable to disease and starvation./
EBA1415_KYLS_5_CB_ES-05672	O	7867	All in all, I believe that many elemets in the wat corals behave and their environment causes coral bleaching. Such element can be water temperature, stress, and need for zooxanthallae to survive. //
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05140	O	7868	Some of the differences that lead to choral bleaching is the diff types of example coral and photosynthesis and coral and zooxanthallae.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_CB_ES-05140	O	7869	The rates per year are different because of the diff things they use for example as shown in the graphs in the article. //
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	O	7870	There are probably several differences in the rates of coral bleaching, but I'm going to tell you about two.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	O	7871	Basically coral bleaching is when coral loses it's natural color.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	O	7872	I'm guessing since there is a lot of wind trade and change in water temperatures the coral can't bare it so it loses color.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	O	7873	Wind trades started in the 1880's so then coral bleaching wasn't that severe.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	R-1-50	7874	Now that wind trades are starting to get severe coral bleaching gets severe.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	R-1-2	7875.1	So because wind trades move different water temperatures some corals in different areas tend to bleach more than others.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	R-2-50	7875.2	So because wind trades move different water temperatures some corals in different areas tend to bleach more than others.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	R-1-50	7876	Since coral bleaching happens more in the Pacific Ocean and so does wind trades, then that means coral bleaching comes from wind trades.
EBA1415post_TWNB_3_CB_ES-04989	R-1-50	7877	So the difference between the rates of Coral bleaching is when wind trades increase coral bleaching increases, and when wind trades decrease coral bleaching decreases.//
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06163	O	7878	What leads to the difference in the rate of coral bleaching is because the temperatures and energy.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06163	R-3-50	7879	The temperature could make it get real cold or hot so it bleach itself during that time.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06163	R-4-50	7880	The energy could help bring oxygen to make carbon dioxide and that's probably how the plant got bleached.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06163	O	7881	But I feel as if my answer is wrong because I don't understand what this process is.
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_CB_ES-06163	O	7882	And I won't until somebody breaks it down to me.//

EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05500	O	7951	The algae provides the coral with chemicals it needs to survive using photosynthesis, and the coral gives the algae a safe place to live.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05500	O	7952	Coral bleaching is the result of the algae inside the coral dying or leaving.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_CB_ES-05500	O	7953	One main cause of coral bleaching is water temperature, which causes the rates of coral bleaching to change often, with warmer or cooler water, the algae will die, causing the coral to be left on their own.

EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04797	O	8008	This because they need algae that live in the corals to help produce light for photosynthesis.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04797	O	8009	Algae is important to the coral also because it provides energy for it to rise.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04797	O	8010	Algae also gain from this because the coral provides a protected nutrient-rich enviornment for the algae.
EBA1415_SEAL_34_CB-04797	R-3-50	8011	So overall, what leads to cloral bleaching is the temperatures in the water.

EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	R-1-50	8079	One reason why coral bleaching rates change is because of trade winds.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	R-1-2	8080	Trade winds drag warm water toward the west and cold water to the eastern pacific.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	R-1-2	8081	Every few years the trade winds switch and they then bring warm water to the east and cold water to the west.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	O	8082	The Movement of the water causes a shift in the world's climate and ocean water temperature increase.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	O	8083	This is not good for coral reefs because they need water temperatures between 70-85 degree F.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	R-3-5	8084	Since coral reefs use photosynthesis to gain energy the change in the water temperature can harm the process of photosynthesis. /
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	O	8085	Another reason why coral bleaching rates change is because of coral and zooxanthallae which is a type of algae.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_CB_ES-04875	O	8086	The zooxantheallae works together with the coral because it passes on food to the coral and also gives the corals their colors.

EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6049	R-6-50	8203	The things that lead to coral bleaching is the changing in our environment that put stress on the coral.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6049	O	8204	Another event that leads to coral bleaching are serious problems with a serious impact on the world's coral reefs.
EBA1415_TRKM_2_CB_ES-6049	R-7-50	8205	When you increase the environment forces the coral to eject their food-producing algae causing the coral bleaching.//
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05444	O	8206	Coral bleaching is when coral plants go from red/pink and turn into plain white.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05444	R-6-50	8207	Coral bleaching occurs when the envoirment changes and it puts a lot of stress onto the coral and then the plant gets bleached and loses it's color.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_CB_ES-05444	O	8208	When bleaching occurs it makes coral plants vunerable to bleaching.  //
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-1-50	8209	Most of the coral bleaching in the world is caused by shifting trade winds.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	O	8210	Trade winds push the water currents east to west.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-1-3	8211	The weaker trade winds there are, the higher water temperatures there are.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-3-50	8212	With the higher water temperatures, the more coral bleaching there is.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	O	8213	In order for corals to do photosynthesis to survive, the water has to be about 70-85 degrees F.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-1-50	8214	If the trade winds keep getting weaken, or if they get too high, the coral won't be able to survive.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-5-50	8215	If the winds don't stay at a good shape consequently the coral won't be able to do photosynthesis, causing them to die.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-1-50	8216.1	Trade winds and the temperature of water, are the causes of coral bleaching.  //
EBA1415_KNKC_1_CB_ES-05434	R-3-50	8216.2	Trade winds and the temperature of water, are the causes of coral bleaching.  //
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	R-13-50	8217	The different rates of coral bleaching is determined by the water/ocean salinity.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8218	As stated iin the text, " Corals are sensitive to the ocean salinity (how salty the water is)."
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	R-12-13	8219	Therefore, it supports the fact that it increases the fresh water in the ocean which causes salinity to decrease.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	R-13-50	8220	The amount of salt determines the rate differences necessary for coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8221	The other thing that leads to different rates are photosynthesis.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8222	Corals count on algae's for the color and the food.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8223	As stated in the text, "The zooxanthealle pass some of the food they make from the sun's energy to the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8224	The algae also provide corals with their colors."
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8225	At times, this doesn't happen based in which they live in.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	R-6-7	8226.1	If a coral is stressed, the environment forces the algae to leave, which causes the coral to diseases and starvation.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	R-7-50	8226.2	If a coral is stressed, the environment forces the algae to leave, which causes the coral to diseases and starvation.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	R-7-50	8227	In the text, it says "This results in a bleaching event that makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation."
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8228	That's why you should know the difference by the color of the coral.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8229	Some corals are pinkish red and some are bleached white.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8230	Polyps, which is functioning the different colors of the color.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8231	Corals sometimes loses their color because of coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8232	Most of it happens in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8233	As stated in the text, "Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color."
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8234	So it varies in how and where the corals are located at.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8235	It's also a serious problem to the corals if it's coral bleaching.
EBA1415_KYNS_3_CB_ES-06001	O	8236	Coastal regions are where most corals receive the coral bleaching, That's because it's near darker areas near land. //
EBA1415_TRJA_6_CB_ES-06088	R-11-50	8237	What leads to coral bleaching is like stuff like hurricanes that deplete the food that it need to sruvive which cause the bleaching.//
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB-04929	R-7-50	8238	Corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB-04929	O	8239	It makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_CB-04929	O	8240	The algae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but corals can sustain physical damage. //
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8241	Coral bleaching is mostly noticeable in the Pacific Ocean.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8242	Coral bleaching is when coral loses it's color.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8243	They usually vary in many different colors but when they get bleached they turn white.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8244	They are only found in clear; shallow, tropical waters.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8245	Coral reefs are made up of polyp.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8246	Over time the polyp hardens, giving the coral a protective skeleton.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8247	This is algae lives in coral tissues and need light for the process of photosynthesis.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	R-3-5	8248	Reef building corals need water temperatures between 70-85 degrees F, because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temperature.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	R-3-4	8249	When the water temp rises the amount of carbon dioxide decreases.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	R-4-14	8250	Changes in the amount of the carbon dioxide mess up the balance that is important to keep corals healthy and safe.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8251	Salinity also can cause harm to the coral.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8252	When the salt level drops in water it may also affect the corals health.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	R-1-50	8253	The weaker the trade winds are the more coral bleaching there is as well which was shown in the graph.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8254	Also shown in the graph the higher the water temps are the less coral bleaching there was as well.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	R-7-50	8255	The coral ends up bleaching due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthellae algae.
EBA1415_BGJD_2_CB_ES-05736	O	8256	When the corals bleach they are in risk of disease and starvation. //
EBA1415_TRJA_6_CB_ES-06094	R-5-5B	8257.1	In the process of coral bleaching coral needs photosynthesis to contain the neutrains that the need to contain their color and health.

EBA1415_TRJA_6_CB_ES-06094	O	8258	In order to do this the coral needs to use sunlight to start the photosynthesis.
EBA1415_TRJA_6_CB_ES-06094	R-4-5	8259	During photosynthesis, zooxanthaelle use energy from the sunlight to combine Carbon Dioxide and the ocean water.
EBA1415_TRJA_6_CB_ES-06094	R-3-5	8260	They also need to be in a certain temperature to perform photosynthesis.//
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	R-4-5	8261	As long as there is enough sunlight and a normal amount of CO2, the algae will undergo photosynthesis.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	O	8262	Reef building corals need the water their in to be between seventy and eighty-five degrees farinheight.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	O	8263	The process of photosythesis is very sensitive to the change of water temperature.

EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	R-11-13	8265	The salt can decrease in shallow coastal regions during tropical storms.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	R-11-13	8266.1	The storms cause the water to be less salty and more fresh.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	R-11-12	8266.2	The storms cause the water to be less salty and more fresh.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	R-13-14	8267	The drop of salinity upsets the balance necessary for coral health.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_CB_ES-05127	O	8268	The movement causes the central and eastern Pacific regions to swell.
