EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	O	172	But there are enways to avoid it, so here are some thing to avoid leading up to skin cancer./
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	R-1-50	173	One thing that leads to skin cancer is where you are at on the earth.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	O	174	What that means is your positioning on the Earths longitude and latitude can matter if your not careful.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	R-1-2	175	Because the closer you are to the equater the closer the sun is.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	R-2-50	176	That is why the closer you are to the sun the more often skin cancer occurs.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	R-2-4	177.1	This is because the sun's direct rays can harm skin cells and at the equator the sun is the harshest./
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	R-1-2	177.2	This is because the sun's direct rays can harm skin cells and at the equator the sun is the harshest./

EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	R-1-5	179	This also relates to the place you are on Earth but mostly sunburns can happen to you almost anywhere.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04817	O	180	A sun burn is when the sun basically burns your skin cells causing pain and a burning feeling.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	O	220	There are many things that lead to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	O	221	FIrst is states "Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	O	222	This can be caused be many different things.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-5-50	223.1	One of the ways skin cancer is caused is direct sunlight.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-2-50	223.2	One of the ways skin cancer is caused is direct sunlight.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-2-3	224.1	In the passage it states that "Generally speaking, the more direct sunlight there is, the more uvb radiation there is." Uvb radiation can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-3-50	224.2	In the passage it states that "Generally speaking, the more direct sunlight there is, the more uvb radiation there is." Uvb radiation can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-3-4	225	Also in the text it states that "...normal amounts of uvb radiation, the rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cell."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-4-4	226.1	If normal uvb radiations are causing damage to skin cells then abnormal uvb radiations would cause a lot more damage to skin cells.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-3-4	226.2	If normal uvb radiations are causing damage to skin cells then abnormal uvb radiations would cause a lot more damage to skin cells.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-5-50	227	Another way is sunburn.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	R-5-50	228	In the passage it states that "Suffering just one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chance of developing skin cancer later on in life."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05428	O	229	This is probably one of the most likely causes.//
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	R-2-50	230	There is many different reasons for causing skin cancer.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	R-2-50	231	One of them is the Sun.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	R-2-50	232	If you stay in sun to much you have a greater chance of skin cancer.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	R-2-4	233	When you get sunburn the sun is killing cells.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	R-1-50	234	In the text it says more cases of cancer is located near the equater.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	R-3-50	235	So this proves that the suns UVB rays cause cancer.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04727	O	236	Also skin is the largest organ so it is more likely to get skin cancer than any other cancer.//
EBA1415_TWNB_2_SC_ES-06184	O	237	Skin cancer covers every region of your bodies in order to protect our inner tissue from infection and loss of water.
EBA1415_TWNB_2_SC_ES-06184	O	238	In addiontion, our skin helps regulate our body.//
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-04899	O	239	The main causes that cause skin cancer are so much but the most dangerous one would be having one at small age.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-04899	R-5-50	240	Well having or getting a mild sunburn and later on in life it leads to the chances of risks to get a skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-04899	O	241	The thing as well is that there's 3 steps to skin cancer but if you check your skin for suspicious changes you can make its easier for you to follow the treatment and maybe get rid of it.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-04899	O	242	In addition your skin can help you as well because your skin has different layers with different jobs to protect your skin.

EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06218	O	616	There are several things that leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06218	O	617	The text states that the skin cancer that develops depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces irregularly.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06218	O	618	There are many disorders, conditions, and diseases in the skin.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06218	O	619	The text says that basal and squamous cell carcinomas, make up approximately 95 percent of skin cancers.

EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06218	O	625	Those are the things that I think leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.//
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-3-50	626.1	The differnce in the risk of developing skin cancer is caused by how much UVb radiation you are getting based on your distance from the equator.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-1-3	626.2	The differnce in the risk of developing skin cancer is caused by how much UVb radiation you are getting based on your distance from the equator.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-2-3	627	The sun releases UVb radiation through sunlight which is harmful for the skin.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	O	628	If the sunlight is very strong, it starts to cause problems because the cells in your skin aren't quick enough to deal with a lot of damage to the skin.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-1-2	629	Sunlight is the strongest when it is hitting directly on the Earh, like the equator and locations around it recieve direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-1-3	630.1	The closer you are the equator, the more vulnerable you are to diret sunlight and strong UVb radiation.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-1-2	630.2	The closer you are the equator, the more vulnerable you are to diret sunlight and strong UVb radiation.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-6-5	631	When this happens, your cells try to repair the skin, which leads to the painful sunburn.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-5-50	632.1	If the sunburn you get is very strong, you have a chance of acquring skin cancer because there are too many damged cells for the body to clear and replace.
EBA1415_SYMS_3_SC_ES-05898	R-6-50	632.2	If the sunburn you get is very strong, you have a chance of acquring skin cancer because there are too many damged cells for the body to clear and replace.

EBA1415_SWAF_6_SC_ES-6231	R-6-50	636.2	Sunburned skin cells that aren't replaced result in cancer.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_SC_ES-6231	O	637	Usually damaged cell are removed and replaced with newer cell, but sometimes the effect doesn't happen.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_SC_ES-6231	R-5-50	638	A serious sunburn in your childhood doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_SC_ES-6231	R-2-5	639	To prevent sun burn try not to get direct sun light.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_SC_ES-6231	R-2-3	640	The more sunlight there is, the more radiation there is.
EBA1415_SWAF_6_SC_ES-6231	R-1-2	641.1	Some locations on the earth have extreme levels of direct sunlight so if your closer to the equator are at higher risk.

EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-50	645.3	There is the factor of latitude/location, Uvb Radiation, Sunburn./
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-1-50	646.1	The first way to develop skin cancer is your latitude/location on the Earth.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-3-50	646.2	The first way to develop skin cancer is your latitude/location on the Earth.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-1-2	647.1	For an example the more closer you are to the equator, well mean the more sunlight you well be exposed to, so the more direct sunlight there is the UVb radiation you'll be exposed to which will lead to the second reason./
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-2-3	647.2	For an example the more closer you are to the equator, well mean the more sunlight you well be exposed to, so the more direct sunlight there is the UVb radiation you'll be exposed to which will lead to the second reason./

EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-50	648.1	Secondly, you can get skin cancer from uvb Radiation.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-3-50	648.2	Secondly, you can get skin cancer from uvb Radiation.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-2-3	649	You are exposed to Uvb radiation from direct sunlight, or just sunlight in general, but the less sun light your exposed to, the less UVb radiation your exposed to.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-3-4	650	UVb Radiation damages/kills small amount of genetic molecules./
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-50	651	My final + third reason is sunburns.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-4	652.1	Sunburns can kill skin cells, but when the skin cells/ dead ones are in the process of being removed, not all dead cells are removed.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-4-6	652.2	Sunburns can kill skin cells, but when the skin cells/ dead ones are in the process of being removed, not all dead cells are removed.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-6	652.3	Sunburns can kill skin cells, but when the skin cells/ dead ones are in the process of being removed, not all dead cells are removed.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-6	653	But it also depends on the severity of the sunburn.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-50	654	Just by having a sunburn can increase the chance's of someone getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	R-5-6	655	Also the more severe the sunburn the more likely when the process when the dead cells are moved, not all dead cells will be removed.
EBA1415_WSAL_2_SC_ES-05362	O	656	This is where the dead cell form together & likely will have to go through a process to form skin cancer.//
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	O	657	Skin is a very important part of our body.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	O	658	It is always at risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	O	659	Some people might be more at risk than others.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	R-1-2	660	For example, If you live near the equator you are closer to the sun than you would be if you were at the north pole.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	R-1-2	661	Since sunlight is shining directly on the equator, your skin would be more exposed and at a greater risk.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	R-1-50	662	According to the graph skin cancer incidence by latitude, There were more skin cancer incidences closer to the equator and less incidences the farther away you got.
EBA1415_BLHT_6_SC_ES-05310	R-2-50	663	In addition to location, amount of time spent in the sun also leads to differences in the risk of skin cancer.

EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	O	1135	But what if all these connected to a main cause of skin cancer?/
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-2-50	1136	Firstly it's skin cancer so what would skin cancer prone skin look like? 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-11-12	1137.1	More likely it would look like skin with low levels of melanin, since it leads to less protection of the sun.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-2-50	1137.2	More likely it would look like skin with low levels of melanin, since it leads to less protection of the sun.

EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-12-3	1138	With less protection from the sun or specifically UVb rays.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-12-5	1139	Which with less protection leads to possible sunburn. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	O	1140	Therefore showing it is a possibility./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-1-5	1141	Secondly your location helps showing the severity of possible sun burn.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	O	1142	Including if you had low melanin levels.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-1-2	1143	Since if you were closer to the equator of course it is warmer due to the axis so the sun levels are way higher compared to those away from the equator.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-11-5	1144.1	So with low melanin and higher sun rays it would most likely lead you to severe sunburn again causing skin cancer./

EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	O	1146	Since all my information has shown how to get sunburn especially a severe sunburn, what does it do?
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-6-50	1147	Well when a sunburn or the sunburn cells do not go away the cells would reproduce irregular cells, which is the cause toward skin cancer or at least is the most likely circumstance due to the cells replicating.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	O	1148	Though other things may occur./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-05494	R-11-50	1149.1	So in conclusion, the main factors to skin cancer are location, melanin levels, and lastly sunburn.

EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05176	R-1-50	1216	One example is the distance from the equator a person lives.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05176	R-1-50	1217	The closer they are to the equator, the higher the risk of skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05176	R-11-50	1218	Another example is the amount of melanin a person has.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05176	R-11-12	1219.1	Melanin is used to protect the skin from solar radiation, so the less Melanin there is in a person, the higher their risk is of developing skin cancer.

EBA1415_TWJB_7_SC_ES-05063	R-3-6	1271	Our bodies can soon repair the damage but in some cases if there is excessive exposure it may not.
EBA1415_TWJB_7_SC_ES-05063	R-2-5	1272.1	Another reason why sunlight is a reason I think people have a higher chance on getting skin cancer is a theory, is because you can get sunburned.

EBA1415_BGJD_1_SC_ES-05727	O	1497	The different types of leads in the risk in getting skin is sunburn, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma./
EBA1415_BGJD_1_SC_ES-05727	O	1498	The sunburn is pretty severe to the skin.
EBA1415_BGJD_1_SC_ES-05727	R-5-50	1499	If a child or a teenager was to just get are serious sunburn it doubles the chances of them getting skin cancer when they are older.
EBA1415_BGJD_1_SC_ES-05727	R-5-50	1500	Even if you get five or more sunburns at any age it also doubles the chances.

EBA1415_BGJD_1_SC_ES-05727	O	1503	So these two skin types make up alot and most people would most likely have this.//
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05445	R-2-50	1504	After reading the articles, it's clear to me that skin cancer is very dangerous and is basically caused by the sun.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05445	O	1505	Too much sun equals too much radiation which equals skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05445	R-5-50	1506	Or you could get skin cancer or die from getting a really bad sunburn.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05445	R-2-3	1507.1	When the sunlight goes on to your body, it's iving of solar radiations that damage your skin and your skin can easily repair it but too much radiation is when skin cancer is caused.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05445	R-3-4	1507.2	When the sunlight goes on to your body, it's iving of solar radiations that damage your skin and your skin can easily repair it but too much radiation is when skin cancer is caused.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05502	R-3-50	1839	Skin cancer is the most common form of skin cancer in the US, since it is caused by exposure to the sun's uvb radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05502	R-2-50	1840	A person's risk of getting skin cancer varies based on a few factors, but every one has some chance of getting it.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05502	R-2-50	1841	One factor is how much direct sunlight they are exposed to year-round.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05502	R-1-50	1842	Those with the most risk live closer to the equator mainly between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn.

EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	R-5-50	1889	The factor I believe affects us the most is sunburn.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	O	1890	When a person receives sunburn, the area that is affected has tons of burned cells with damaged genetic molecules.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	R-2-5	1891.1	These cells with sun poisoning go through mutations, and become abnormal such that skin cancer is triggered.

EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	R-2-5	1892	The process happens from absorbing to much direct sunlight or vitamin D.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	O	1893	By avoiding this outcome it is essential to protect your skin by sitting in the shade, not going to the beach, avoiding really sunny days, or just decreasing the amount of sun you obtan by wearing sun tan lotion.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	R-1-50	1894	Lattitude is another distrubing factor that pertains to skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	R-1-2	1895	Lattitude can determine how much direct light an area receives from the Sun.
EBA1415_SDLC_6_SC_ES-04746	R-1-2	1896	It is said in the Lattitude and Direct Sunlight page that the clsoer you are to the equator the more direct sunlight you will receive.

EBA1415_TWDG_1_SC_ES-04934	O	1907	This condition is one of the msot feared because everyone is at risk.
EBA1415_TWDG_1_SC_ES-04934	O	1908	There are three types of skin cancers the basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWDG_1_SC_ES-04934	O	1909	The virus that causes the msot deaths is malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWDG_1_SC_ES-04934	R-2-50	1910.1	The people that are the most at risk are people who live closer to the equator because they are getting the most direct sunlight.//

EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1912	Well first, lets talk about our skin, it is the largest organ in our bodies.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1913	And it covers a region of our body in order to protect the inner tissue from infection and loss in water.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1914	But then at time we can bumb into diffuculties leading to many skin disorders, conditions, and diseases.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1915	But out of them all the worst kind of thing that you can get is skin cancer!
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1916	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-2-50	1917.1	And diffrent ways to get skin cancer are the Latitude and direct sunlight.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1918	Latitude and Longititude are measured in degrees and distances from the center of the earth.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-1-2	1919	Then ther is one are were you can mostly be affected by the sun and that is the equator, and imaginary line around the earth at zero degrees latitude.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-1-2	1920	This place has the amount of direct sunlight that can affect you.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-1-2	1921.1	If you are clsoer you are at a higher risk of geting skin cancer because there is more consistent direct sunlight.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-2-50	1921.2	If you are clsoer you are at a higher risk of geting skin cancer because there is more consistent direct sunlight.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-5-50	1922	And another way you can get skin cancer is from a sunburn.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1923	Not just a sunburn, it is a severe sunburn called sun poisioning.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-5-4	1924.1	Normal sunburns damage cells and then later are replaced with healthy ones.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-4-6	1924.2	Normal sunburns damage cells and then later are replaced with healthy ones.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-5-6	1925.1	But this severe sunburn that can't remove sunburned skin cells will then lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-6-50	1925.2	But this severe sunburn that can't remove sunburned skin cells will then lead to skin cancer.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-5-50	1926	And is most likely to happen if you have five or more sunburns.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	R-4-5	1927	The more damage to genetic molecules can lead to the worst sunburn ever.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5431_9	O	1928	So then skin cancer can develop through many types of ways.//
EBA1415_LVSNa_7_SC_ES-05999	O	1929	There was no difference.
EBA1415_LVSNa_7_SC_ES-05999	R-2-50	1930	The spoke about how skin cancer is a risk to people who put ink or poisonous mark on their skin and people who are exposed to extreame amounts of sunlight (UVB).
EBA1415_LVSNa_7_SC_ES-05999	O	1931	I knew of this before this lesson because I was tought of it from family members of the risks.//
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-3-50	1932	Explaining what leads to difference in the risk of developing skin cancer is uvb radiation.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-3-4	1933	Uvb radiation is a type of solar radiation that can cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-2-3	1934	There is ways uvb radiation is exposed, the sun./
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-2-3	1935.1	The first way uvb radiation is exposed by the sun is because of you latitude the closer you are to the equator the more uvb radiation there is.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-1-3	1935.2	The first way uvb radiation is exposed by the sun is because of you latitude the closer you are to the equator the more uvb radiation there is.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-1-2	1936	As it says in Latitude and Direct Sunlight "As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to the equator, the more consistent direct sunlight will be."
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-2-50	1937	This means that direct sunlight tends to more cancer./
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-5-50	1938	The second thing that can develop skin cancer is sunburn.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05109	R-5-4	1939.1	Sunburn can damage skin calls critically.

EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	O	2233	It covers every region of our bodies in order to protect our inner tissue from infection and less of water.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	O	2234	In addition, our skin helps reglate our body temperature.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	O	2235	If you took off your skin and laid it flat, it would cover an area of approximately 21 square feet.

EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	R-4-5	2241	Sun burn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	R-5-6	2242	Sun burn happens when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	O	2243	The damaged cells are replaced with healthy ones.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-06186	O	2244	This additional blood flow is the reason skin become red.

EBA1415_SDLC_8_SC_ES-04754	R-2-50	2250	There are different ways to get skin cancer just from the sun.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_SC_ES-04754	R-5-50	2251	You can get basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma from a very bad sunburn.
EBA1415_SDLC_8_SC_ES-04754	R-5-6	2252	Depending on how severe the sunburn is, it'll be less likely that all damaged skin cells are removed if it is very severe.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-3-50	2422	There are many ways that you can develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-3-50	2423.1	The most common is being over exposed to uvb radiation from the sun.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-2-3	2423.2	The most common is being over exposed to uvb radiation from the sun.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-2-50	2424	Being exposed to the sun for a long time is the most case of skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-5-6	2425	In the sunburn text it states that "if a sun burn is severe enough, it becomes less likely that all the damaged cells will be removed"
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-3-6	2426	This shows me that the more you're exoposed to uvb rays the lower chance of damaged skin cells will be removed.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2427	There are also other results to exposion of uvb rays.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-5-50	2428	In the text it states "these chances also double if a person has five or more sunburns at any age."
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-5-6	2429.1	The more you get sunburned the harder it will be to repair the cells and that will cause you to have a better chance of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-6-50	2429.2	The more you get sunburned the harder it will be to repair the cells and that will cause you to have a better chance of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2430	This does not mena we should not go out side all the time but we have to be careful with how much time we spend out in the sun.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2431	There is also another way you can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2432	That way being of natural skin disorders.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	R-3-50	2433	You can also be born with it, uvb rays are not the only cause to skni cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2434	In the text it states "skin cancer is the incontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells."
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2435	This shows me that if you are born with a gene that makes your skin cells grow abnormally you can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05589	O	2436	Skin cancer is a very bad thing and you can prevent it by using sun screen for the uvb rays.//
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2437	Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer throughout united states.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2438	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2439	Skin cancer can occur when you have that irregular skin that can get anything.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2440	Our skin protect our inner tissue from infections and loss of water, addition our skins helps regulate body temperature.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2441	The varieties of skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2442	Together, basal and squamous cell carcinomas make-up approximetly 95 percent of our skin cancers.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2443	Malignant melanoma only occurs in approxiametly 5 percent of skin cancers cases.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2444	Malignant melanoma in responsible for the most deaths from skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2445	Skin cancer is like a sunburn the skin cancer has a dark patch look caused by basal cell carcinoma.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2446	You have to be aware of living close to the equator.
EBA1415_TTCM_2_SC_ES-04926	O	2447	But those who live in away from the equator is 50/50 ok cause the sun can come get you.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05329	R-5-50	2448	Serious sunburns can lead to the development of skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05329	R-3-5	2449	The skin gets burned by the suns radiation.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05329	R-5-50	2450	Depending on the severity of your sunburn decides if you are at risk of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05329	R-3-4	2451	UVb radiation is a type of solar radiation that can harm your skin.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05329	R-2-3	2452	The more sunlight there is, them ore UVb radiation there will be.//
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05329	O	2453	Ran out of time.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2454	There are numorous skin disorder condition and diseases.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2455	There are 3 main varieties of skin cancer:  basal cell carcinoma, squamoas cell carcinomia, and malignant melanoiama.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-5-6	2456.1	Sun burn skin cells that aren't removed can cause skin cancer.

EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2457	Sun burn frequently include painful burning sensation in results of skin cancer.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-1-2	2458	The more close you are to the equater the more sunlight you'll get direct.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2459	It'll be unlikly that all skin cells will be removed.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2460	If you had them in your childhood more likely you'll get them back.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2461	Checking your skin suspicoucly chanses can help you detect skin cancer at an earlier stage.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2462	I also think another way to get skin cancer is by tanning machines.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	O	2463	When you do alot you can get cancer.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-4-5	2464	More damage to genetic molecules leads to severe sunburn.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-5-50	2465	These chances can double if a person has 5 or more sunburns at any age.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-1-2	2466	Some locations have moderate to exteam levels of year-round direct sunlight.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-2-3	2467.1	Due to the amount of direct sunlight the amount of uvb ratiation is also high.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-3-5	2467.2	Due to the amount of direct sunlight the amount of uvb ratiation is also high.
EBA1415_KYLS_5_SC_ES-05656	R-5-50	2468.1	Sunburn can happen after because not all people are aware to what can burn your skin leading to skin cancer.

EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	O	2470	Skin cancer is the largest form of cancer in the U.S.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	O	2471	Skin cancer is caused when skin cells reproduce irregularly.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	O	2472	Depending on how the abnormal growth of skin cells devopes, the type of cancer changes.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	O	2473	"There are three main varieties of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma." (Background: Skin Damage, no author listed).
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-1-50	2474.1	The closer you are to the equator, according to "Skin Cancer Incidence By Latitude", the more likely you are going to contract skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-2-50	2474.2	The closer you are to the equator, according to "Skin Cancer Incidence By Latitude", the more likely you are going to contract skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-2-50	2475.1	This is because the closer you are to the equator, the more exposed you are to direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-1-2	2475.2	This is because the closer you are to the equator, the more exposed you are to direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-2-4	2476	When our skin is exposed to excessive amounts of sunlight, our skin damages./
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-5-50	2477	Sunburns are another way you can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-5-6	2478.1	If the sunburned skin cells are not removed, you can get skin cancer./
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	R-6-50	2478.2	If the sunburned skin cells are not removed, you can get skin cancer./
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	O	2479	As you can see, you can get skin cancer from many places.
EBA1415_SEKL_1_SC_ES-04813	O	2480	So always take precautions, wear sunscreen & check for suspicious skin changes.//
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05965	O	2481	There are all different causes for risk in Skin Cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05965	R-1-3	2482.1	First, if you live in an area with higher UV rays/more powerful, you are at more risk of damaged skin cells.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05965	R-3-4	2482.2	First, if you live in an area with higher UV rays/more powerful, you are at more risk of damaged skin cells.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05965	O	2483	Also, if you are younger, you already have more possibility of contracting any skin cancer, especially if you've had more than one sunburn.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05965	R-11-50	2484	Also, if you have a less amount of melalin in your skin, you are more likely to get skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-5-50	2485.1	Differences that would lead in the risk of developing skin cancer would be Sunburn, Uvb radiation, less melanin and the amount of sunlight direct in each year.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-3-50	2485.2	Differences that would lead in the risk of developing skin cancer would be Sunburn, Uvb radiation, less melanin and the amount of sunlight direct in each year.

EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-5-6	2486.1	Firstly, in the text "Sunburn" it states, "Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer" ("Sunburn").
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-6-50	2486.2	Firstly, in the text "Sunburn" it states, "Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer" ("Sunburn").
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-5-6	2487.1	This shows that if sunburned cells that are developed in the skin are not removed then it can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-6-50	2487.2	This shows that if sunburned cells that are developed in the skin are not removed then it can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	O	2488	This connects back to how it can develop skin cancer because it's a differance in the many other ways.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	O	2489	This is important because if this is regularly happening then others can be in danger of death.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-11-12	2490.1	Secondly, in the text "your skin protects you" it states, "Uvb radiation is a type of solar radiation... less melanin... decreases our chances of protection from Uvb radiation" ("Protects You").

EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-3-50	2491.1	This shows that if this kind of radiation from the sun can't be stopped then it could result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-2-3	2491.2	This shows that if this kind of radiation from the sun can't be stopped then it could result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	O	2492	This is important because it connects back to another factor that could result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-11-12	2493.1	Less Melanin can result in bad protection against this radiation.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-12-3	2493.2	Less Melanin can result in bad protection against this radiation.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	R-1-2	2494	Thirdly, in the text "Latitude and Direct Sunlight" it states, "The more closer you are to the equator, the more consistent direct sunlight will be... people closer to the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight" ("Direct Sunlight).
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	O	2495	This shows that if others are not more aware of their surroundings that it can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05992	O	2496	In conclusion, these reasons are the differences in the risks of developing skin cancer.//
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-5-50	2497.1	What leads to developing skin cancer is the area that we may live and any type of sunburn in are life.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-1-50	2497.2	What leads to developing skin cancer is the area that we may live and any type of sunburn in are life.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-1-2	2498	As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to the equator, the more consistent the direct sunlight will be.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-1-50	2499	That will mean the closer you are to the equator, the more chances of danger or possibly skin cancer.

EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-4-5	2500.2	Sunburn is caused by genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-5-6	2501	It happens when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or removed damaged cells.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	O	2502	Severe sunburn is called poisoning.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	O	2503	Sun poisoning can lead to infection and shock.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	O	2504	In extreme cases it can lead to death.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-5-50	2505	Suffering one sunburn during childhood or adolescence doubles the chance of developing skin cancer in life.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05441	R-5-50	2506	These chances also doubles if a person has 5 or more sunburns at any age.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2710	There are many reasons and factors that go into why you can get skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2711	The three types of skin cancer include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2712	About 95% of skin cancers are made up of the basal cell carcinoma and the squamous cell carcinoma.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	R-1-2	2713	The closer you are to the equator, the more direct sunlight there is.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	R-2-50	2714	The more direct sunlight you are in contact with, the higher the chance of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2715	Uvb radiation is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2716	A normal amount of uvb radiation is okay because your body has melanin which protects us against it.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	R-12-3	2717.1	However, when you have to much uvb radiation your body isnt able to protect your skin and creates large amounts of damage to genetic molecules in your skin cells.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2719	But the effects can be very serious.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	R-5-50	2720	Suffering just one severe sunburn in your childhood doubles your chance of getting skin cancer later on.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	R-5-50	2721	If you have 5 or more sunburns at any age you also double your chances of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	R-5-50	2722	So, the more sunburns you get, the more likely you are to get skin cancer at some point in your life.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05508	O	2723	If you periodically check your skin for suspicious changes, the chance of getting skin cancer and being able to successfully treat it goes up.//

EBA1415_RDCS_1_SC-06003	O	3073	There is one type that occurs in every few skin cancer cases Malignant melanoma, but is responsible for most deaths of skin cancer. //
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	O	3074	It may be a surprise to you, that our skin is the largest organ that covers our body, but the thing that you didn't know is that our skin is prone to skin damage, which can lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	O	3075	Well now you might ask, "what leads to the differences in the risk of developing skin cancer"?
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	O	3076	Well, now I might say that skin cancer is caused when you have a large amount of sun exposier that forced on you, let me put an example, so you might be at a beach, on the coast of Brazil, there you relax, and sit in the sand enjoying the air, (breeze) and sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	O	3077	With that you fall asleep, and you wake up an hour later, hot, and painful, you realize you forgot to put on sun screen, so you rush back to your hotel room, and notice you are all red, great.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-1-5	3078	You got sun burned because of the climate, you are visitng, you are in Brazil, which is close to the equator, which is mostly hot, humid, and sunny.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-1-2	3079.1	With being near the equator, the sunlight is directed closely to you.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-2-50	3079.2	With being near the equator, the sunlight is directed closely to you.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-2-50	3080	So that is one reason how skin cancer can lead to you.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	O	3081	Our skin is composed of three layers, with this example this person has damaged a large amount of there skin cells, that would made up the epidermis, the dermis, and subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-2-4	3082	From this example this person could have damage the epidermis, and parts of the dermis, from the exposier of the sun rays.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-5-50	3083.1	This person is sunburned, and if they cannot get rid, or cure the burn, (removed) this can result in skin cancer, thats why its very important to put on sun block on yourself when you are exposed to the sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	R-6-50	3083.2	This person is sunburned, and if they cannot get rid, or cure the burn, (removed) this can result in skin cancer, thats why its very important to put on sun block on yourself when you are exposed to the sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_1_SC_ES-05945	O	3084	It is less likely that the cells would be treated when you have a sun burn, it all depends on the likelyhood of your childhood or adolescence, when the risk doubles.//
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	R-2-50	3085	Skin cancer is a disease you get when you have to much interaction with the sun.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3086	It causes your skin cells to double or grow at a quicker rate.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3087	The main thing to know is your skin covers every single part of your body, making it the largest organ in/on your body.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3088	Skin is made up of three layers, your epidermis, then the dermis, finally the subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3089	Making it a good barrier to protect your body from any enemies your body doesn't want.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3090	Your biggest enemy just may be the sun!
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	R-5-50	3091	You can get skin cancer usually from a sunburn.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	R-5-6	3092	Sunburns cause your skin cells to come help the damaged skin cells.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3093	The reason your skin turns red is due to the extra blood growing near that body part.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3094	There are three types of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3095	The first being basal cell carcinoma, second is squamous cell carcinoma, and last being malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3096	Together basal and squamous cell carcinomas make up about 95% of skin cancer. 
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC-5956	O	3097	Leaving the other 5% to malignant melanoma.//
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	R-2-50	3098	Skin cancer is one os the most dieseses you do not want to have.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3099	It basically takes your skin and turns it into something you don't want.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3100	I don't have it but I can tell it'sbad because of really the affick.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	R-2-50	3101	I guess the only way to cause it is by being exposed to the sun.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	R-2-5	3102	When its really hot, for example: If we are here in the equator, we could get sun burns every day because it's so hot out.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3103	I can't imagine being in the sun to long can cause so many things.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3104	even if you move away from the equator you'll still have problems.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3105	I like the sun, but I also hate it!
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3106	I got like 7 sunburns because of being in the sun too long.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3107	That's when I was 7.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	O	3108	I was hard dealing with the sun burn but it was fine.
EBA1415_ERSK_7_SC_ES-05796	R-2-5	3109	Besides, I don't get sunburn's any more because I'm not out side for 7-8 hours in the day.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3110	Skin cancer is a serious type of disease.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3111	Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in America.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3112	Even though some people are at a a higher risk of developing it, anybody can get it.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3113	There are three main different varieties of skin cancer - basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3114	Basal and squamous cell carcinoma make up 95% of skin cancers./
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	R-5-50	3115	The main cause of this cancer is sunburn.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	R-2-5	3116	If you are in direct sunlight, you have a higher chance of getting sunburned.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	R-1-2	3117	The closer you are to the equator, the more you will be in direct sunlight./
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3118	You should always but on sunscreen, because if you don't, there is a good chance you will get sunburn.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3119	Sun poisoning - also known as sunburn - can lead to infection and shock.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3120	In some extreme cases, it can even cause death./
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	R-5-50	3121	Suffering from just one sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chance of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	R-5-50	3122	Also, these chances also double if a person has five or more sunburns at any age.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3123	Your skin is your largest organ and your body's protector.
EBA1415_SEAL_78_SC_ES-4800	O	3124	We should always be causation and apply sun-screen before going outdoors or in the the sun.//
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05067	O	3125	Skin cancer is a big problem that people need to be aware of.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05067	R-1-50	3126	We have to let them know, the difference's that lead up to skin cancer is the latitude.

EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05067	O	3129	The are numerous skin disorders, conditions, and diseaseas, that is why it is important to take care of your skin.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05067	O	3130	There are signs that you can look for in order to know if you got any kind of skin dieases.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05067	O	3131	For example if you have dark patchs to the right of your eye that is caused by a basal cell carcinoma.
EBA1415_TWJB_5_SC_ES-05067	R-3-50	3132	Skin cancer really just come's from to much radiation.

EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	R-1-50	3139	There are three main causes of skin cancer: skin type, location, and carelessness./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	R-2-50	3140	Sunlight is the major cause of skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	O	3141	In sunlight, there is UVb radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	R-3-50	3142	UVb radiation causes the abnormal growth of different skin cells, which is the start of skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	O	3143	Every person is exposed to the sun but the effects of radiation depend on skin type.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	R-11-50	3144	People with fairer skin generally have a greater chance of developing skin cancer because of the lack of melatin.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05960	R-11-12	3145.1	Melatin protects humans from radiation so people with darker skin have more protection and less risk of skin cancer./

EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05140	O	3714	Sometimes it may or may not repair the body with new cells.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05140	R-5-50	3715	Sometimes suffering from one serious sunburn early in childhood may then cause skin cancer later on in life.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05140	R-5-50	3716	These chances also double up if the person has 5 or more sunburns at any type of age.//
EBA1415_LRJE_5_SC_ES-05128	R-5-50	3717.1	First, sunburns can lead to skin cancer is the sunburn skin cells haven't been removed.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_SC_ES-05128	R-5-6	3717.2	First, sunburns can lead to skin cancer is the sunburn skin cells haven't been removed.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_SC_ES-05128	R-5-50	3718	Also, it says that just by suffering one serious sunburn can double the chances for you later in lif to get skin cancer.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_SC_ES-05128	R-1-50	3719	Secondly, skin cancer could be also caused by the location you live.
EBA1415_LRJE_5_SC_ES-05128	R-1-2	3720.1	Like they also said if you are closer to the equator it's a higher chance because of the more direct sunlight  you get.//
EBA1415_LRJE_5_SC_ES-05128	R-2-50	3720.2	Like they also said if you are closer to the equator it's a higher chance because of the more direct sunlight  you get.//
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	O	3721	Cancer is very deadly and skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the U.S.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	O	3722	It causes to many abnormal skin cells to keep growing inside someone's bodyand weakens the skin to be able to protect your body, and causes changes in apperance.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	O	3723	However there are some ways in which will determine a person's risk of developign skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-2-5	3724.1	The amount of sunlight a person gets based on their location from the equator, exposure of UVb radiation, and the amount of sun exposure that could lead to sunburns can make a person's risk of developing skin cancer different./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-1-2	3724.2	The amount of sunlight a person gets based on their location from the equator, exposure of UVb radiation, and the amount of sun exposure that could lead to sunburns can make a person's risk of developing skin cancer different./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-3-5	3724.3	The amount of sunlight a person gets based on their location from the equator, exposure of UVb radiation, and the amount of sun exposure that could lead to sunburns can make a person's risk of developing skin cancer different./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-5-50	3724.4	The amount of sunlight a person gets based on their location from the equator, exposure of UVb radiation, and the amount of sun exposure that could lead to sunburns can make a person's risk of developing skin cancer different./
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-2-50	3725.1	The amount of sunlight a person is exposured to based on where they are located from the equator can have a big impact on wheather a person getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-1-2	3725.2	The amount of sunlight a person is exposured to based on where they are located from the equator can have a big impact on wheather a person getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-1-2	3726	In the text, it states, "As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to the Equator, the more consistent direct sunlight will be.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	O	3727	This means people closer to the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight."
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-1-2	3728.1	This evidence clearly shows that position near the equator contributes to differences in risk of skin cancer since more sunlight is in the area on the equator since its where its getting more sun.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-2-50	3728.2	This evidence clearly shows that position near the equator contributes to differences in risk of skin cancer since more sunlight is in the area on the equator since its where its getting more sun.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-1-50	3729.1	Also, on the graph on Skin Cancer Incidence by Latitude show that people who were much more near to the equator (25o-30o), have the most skin cancer incidences than those who are 50o-60o north of the equator.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-3-50	3729.2	Also, on the graph on Skin Cancer Incidence by Latitude show that people who were much more near to the equator (25o-30o), have the most skin cancer incidences than those who are 50o-60o north of the equator.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-3-50	3730.1	In addition, too much exposure to UVb radiation is another fact in determining someone's risk contributing to that, having less melanin,w hich is easier to make vitamin D, can also determine how bad the UVb radiation will impact a person's body/skin.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-11-3	3730.2	In addition, too much exposure to UVb radiation is another fact in determining someone's risk contributing to that, having less melanin,w hich is easier to make vitamin D, can also determine how bad the UVb radiation will impact a person's body/skin.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05235	R-3-4	3731	In the article, it states, "Using both human skin cells and a mouse model, researchers have found that when the skin is hit with normal amounts of UVb radiation, the rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in th skin cells... however, problems arise when there is excessive exposure to UVb radiation."
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-3-50	3732	Exposure to too much UVb radiation can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-4-50	3733.1	Skin cancer, one of the most common cancers in the U.S., is caused by many things other than exposure to sun light.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-2-50	3733.2	Skin cancer, one of the most common cancers in the U.S., is caused by many things other than exposure to sun light.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-4-50	3734	Dead skin cells on our body can also cause it.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-5-6	3735	After getting sunburned, our body produces more skin cells to clear away the damaged or dead ones.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-6-50	3736	Sometimes though, they stay there and we eventually develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-2-50	3737	Also recieving too much direct sunlight can develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFMV_3_SC_ES-05840	R-1-2	3738	The closer you are to the equator, the more direct sunlight, you receive year round.//
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	O	3739	There are many was for you to develope skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	O	3740	A little known fact about the skin is that it is the biggest organ of the body.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	R-2-5	3741.1	One way you can get skin cancer is exposure of too much sun on your skin canc lead to a severe sun burn which can lead to skin cancer if the sunburned skin cells aren't removed.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	R-5-6	3741.2	One way you can get skin cancer is exposure of too much sun on your skin canc lead to a severe sun burn which can lead to skin cancer if the sunburned skin cells aren't removed.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	R-6-50	3741.3	One way you can get skin cancer is exposure of too much sun on your skin canc lead to a severe sun burn which can lead to skin cancer if the sunburned skin cells aren't removed.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	O	3742	There are three types of skin cancer called basic cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06217	O	3743	There are many ways how you can get skin cancer, but you can die from this desease//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05168	R-1-50	3744	A few ways of leading the risk of developing skin cancer are if you're closer to the equator, the closer you will get onto getting cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05168	R-1-2	3745	My evidence for this would be where in the text it says "The most year-round direct sunlight occurs between the tropics of cancer (23oN) and Capricorn (23oS).
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05168	R-2-3	3746	Due to the amount of direct sunlight in these areas, the amount of UVb is also high."
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05168	R-2-50	3747.1	Therefore I say that the more and closer you are to the sun the more higher risk you will to getting skin cancer.//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05168	R-1-50	3747.2	Therefore I say that the more and closer you are to the sun the more higher risk you will to getting skin cancer.//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05168	O	3748	not done
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	O	3749	on the twenty third of september I read five articles about how skin cancer can develope.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	R-2-50	3750	There are numerous types of disorders that the sun can cause but cancer is the most concerning.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	O	3751	There are three types of skin cancer there is basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	R-2-50	3752	Since the earth is at an angle different amount of sunlight hit the earth which can either increase or decrease our chances of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	R-1-3	3753	The pople more to the equator are more likely to get hit by uvb radiation while the people further from the equator are less likely.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	O	3754	Now you may be asking yourself "don't we all get hit with uvb radiation?"
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	R-2-4	3755.1	The answer is yes everytime we get we get hit by the sun our genetic molecules in the skin cells are damaged, but our bodys could fix the damage.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	R-4-6	3755.2	The answer is yes everytime we get we get hit by the sun our genetic molecules in the skin cells are damaged, but our bodys could fix the damage.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	O	3756	Sunburns are a different story.
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	R-5-50	3757	When we get sun birns one serious sunburn you are more likely to get cancer and chances increase with five or more./
EBA1415_KYNS_4_SC_ES-05400	O	3758	ran out of time//
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	R-5-50	3759	It can be caused by having sunburn alot.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	O	3760	If you get sunburne alot it it is possible that you can get sun posining and that can lead to death.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	R-5-4	3761.1	When you get sunburn your cells are getting killed.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	R-4-6	3761.2	When you get sunburn your cells are getting killed.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	R-4-6	3762	So when those ones die there are new cells that grow and take there place.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	O	3763	There are 3 layers to our skin.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	O	3764	The sun gives our skin videman D.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05826	R-4-6	3765	They say more damaged skin cells there are they all might not get a new cell.//
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	O	3766	Our skin helps regulate our body temprature, although we take our skin for granted, there are several ways for things to go wrong with our skin.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-1-50	3767.1	One way a person can get skin cancer is their exposure to "latitude and direct sunlight" people closer to the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-2-50	3767.2	One way a person can get skin cancer is their exposure to "latitude and direct sunlight" people closer to the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-1-2	3768	Those who live in areas with less direct sunlight may be less concerned about any dangers, although there are still some risks associated with sun no matter where you live.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	O	3769	"Your skin protects you" but like the article say "many experimental studies of plants and animals and clinical studies of humans have demonstrated harmful effects of exposure to uvb radiation."
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	O	3770	This means although your skin protects you there are still some dangers that can effect your skin.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-5-50	3771.1	1 popular to get skin cancer is through sun burn, the severity of some burns can really damage the skin.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-4-5	3771.2	1 popular to get skin cancer is through sun burn, the severity of some burns can really damage the skin.

EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-6-50	3772.2	Sunburned skin cells that aren't can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-5-50	3773	Suffering one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-5-50	3774	These chances also double if a person has five or more sunburns at any age.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	O	3775	According to the "sunburn" article.
EBA1415_LRBL_3_SC_ES-05157	R-1-50	3776	As one can see skin cancer can be present through your latitude & direct sunlight, sunburns and even your skins background.//
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	O	3777	The differences in risk of developing skin cancer can vary from where you live, your skin tone (melanin in skin), and if you've had any type of sun burn or skin disorder.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	O	3778	People who live close to the sun don't have an advantage from people who live further north.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	R-1-2	3779.1	There fore if you live near the equator, which has the most sunlight captured, then you have a higher risk of getting sunburn.

EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	O	3782	Mitosis duplicates your new cells and fills them in to your damaged cells.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	O	3783	Now during this mitosis process cell can come into disorder, maybe one cell an become corrupt and won't stop duplicating.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	O	3784	The mutation in that cell causes skin cancer.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	O	3785	Another difference that it said was skin tone.
EBA1415_RHSGa_3_SC_ES-05924	R-11-12	3786.1	Lighter skinned people don't have as much protection from the Uvb rays (ultralight) because of the lack of melanin.

EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05138	R-2-5	3793	If you go to the beach too much or someplace where there's a lot of sun, you might get a sunburn.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05138	R-5-6	3794	Sun burns are mostly when damaged cells in your body get replaced with healthier ones and so, that is why it causes skin to get red; it's because of the additional blood flow.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05138	O	3795	Sunburns can definitely cause death at times if the burn is too bad or is within cells that are just way too many to replace.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05138	O	3796	Sun burns also actually burn your skin because of the blood flowing and it's a bad pain.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05138	O	3797	Our skin in our bodies is our largest organ which exists to protect us from either too hot or too cold temperatures, water loss, and other very important things like that.

EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	O	3811	The skin is the largest organ.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	R-12-3	3812	It protects you from alot of things such as: solar radiation, extreme temperatures, and chemicals.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	O	3813	The skin has three layers, outermost layer is the epidermis, middle layer is the dermis, and the innermost layer is subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	R-5-50	3814	Skin cancer can be caused by alot of things but "sunburn" is one of them.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	R-6-50	3815	Sunburn happens when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	O	3816	The damaged cells get replaced with healthy ones.
EBA1415_TWMD_67_SC_ES-05002	R-5-6	3817	If the burn is severe its called "sun poisoning".

EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05953	O	3837	What differences in the risk of developing skin cancer is many to start with and it can be dangerous all do in their system.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05953	R-1-2	3838.1	One of them is the the latitude of the earth axis to direct sunlight, since the Earth tilts in a certain angle, different amount of sunlight is then shone onto Earth surface which counts a lot to how it can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05953	R-3-50	3838.2	One of them is the the latitude of the earth axis to direct sunlight, since the Earth tilts in a certain angle, different amount of sunlight is then shone onto Earth surface which counts a lot to how it can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05953	R-1-50	3839	The graph showing how the altitude and direct sunlight can effect people by looking at it, the more the latitude is decreased the higher chances have the population being affected with skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05953	R-3-5	3840.1	UVb radition, another of type to infect, is quite harmful to the skin of excessive exposure to this radiation even though our body has a defense for that, too much can still lead to skin cancer chances of affecting people.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05493	R-2-50	3846	Skin cancer as we know it forms whne there is to much exposure to the sun's harmful rays.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05493	R-1-2	3847	As stated i the passage "depending on location, amount of direct sunlight may vary alot or a little throughout the year."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05493	R-1-50	3848	This piece from the passage proves that location plays a leading role in skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05493	O	3849	The same source also states, "Those who live close to the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05493	R-1-50	3850	So what this proves is that people who live farther away from the equator have less of a chance of developing any form of skin cancer then people close to the equator do.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-05493	R-3-50	3851.1	So in conclusion, anyone, anywhere can develope skin cancer because the suns uvb rays are everywhere but new information has led us to believe that where we live plays a much bigger part in it than we may even know.//

EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05527	R-1-50	3892	Also, the higher North above the equator you go, the risk of getting skin cancer declines.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05527	O	3893	A person's own expiriences and functions can determine the risk of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05527	R-5-50	3894	For example, a person who has expinenced one serious sunburn during childhood or 5 sunburns at any age has a higher risk of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05527	R-11-50	3895	Another example would be people that produce that Melanin than others have a less likely chance of getting skin cancer than people who don't.

EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	R-2-50	4080	I think the things that also leads to skin cancer is also dirt and ashes that be in chimneys because the ashes in chimney's are second to caused more harm to the skin as much as the sun's ray does and mostly it occurs when the ashes be on your skin and it can sometimes be hard to get rid of it.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	R-4-50	4081	If it's not clean properly then it may start to damage your skin easily and can cause skin cancer./
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	R-2-50	4082	The other differences for the leading cause of skin cancer is sunlight.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	R-3-4	4083.1	There's name for rapid sun heat and that is ultraviolet light which can harm the skin easily which may cause skin cance./

EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	O	4085	The only purpose from them is it's natural resource.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	R-2-4	4086	The sun's ray does more damage to the skin than dirts can do.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	O	4087	That's why you have to understand that skins is the only largest organ to protect the flesh in you and be aware of direct sunlight and avoid getting sunburns.
EBA1415_TRWH_8_SC_ES-06077	O	4088	Also, never be under the sun too long otherwise you'll end the same of what happen to some people who has the exact skin problems.//
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC_ES-05643	O	4089	There are many types of skin damages but the most fearfull of the skin damages is skin cancer, but there are also many different types of skin cancer like basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma witch together basal, squamous cell carcinoma make up approximately 95 percent of skin cancers.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC_ES-05643	O	4090	Then there is malignant melanoma witch only occurs in approximately 5 percent, However malignant melanoma is the class of most death's from skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_4_SC_ES-05643	O	4091	We need to keep shock on your skin to see if there are any changes in your skin because the skin on our bodies is our biggest organ.//

EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	O	4093	There are many ways of developing the risk of skin cancer.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	R-5-50	4094	One of the reasons of risk of skin cancer is by sunburn.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	R-2-5	4095	Sunburn ocurs when a person either stays in the sun too long until their skin starts to burn up.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	O	4096	If your sunburn is sever it is called sun poisoning.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	O	4097	Sun poisoning lends to infections and extreme shocking throughout your body.

EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	O	4102	Their are three types of skin cancer; basal cell carcinoma, squamos cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_AEKD_4_SC_ES-05570	O	4103	Malignant melanoma is the number one cause of death.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06215	O	4104	There are three main varieties of skin cancer: basal cell carinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06215	O	4105	UVb radiation is a solar radiation.
EBA1415_TWJB_56_SC_ES-06215	R-3-4	4106	When the skin is hit with normal amounts of UVb radiation it causes small amount of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.

EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4111	There are other diseases that are associated with skin, but this has to be the most common because everyone is at risk.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	R-2-5	4112	When you are exposed to too much direct sunlight, you are most likely to get sun burn.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	R-2-4	4113	The amount of sunlight you get can damage your genetic molecules in your skin.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4114	This is why your skin turns red; your body is trying to repair your cells so extra blood might be circulating and turning your skin a dark red./
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	R-5-50	4115	If the sunburn is very severe, it can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4116	In most cases this doesn't happen, but it is possible!
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4117	Even though we all have skin that does it's job to protect us, it can't protect everything.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4118	There is only so much radiation that your body can take.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4119	With this information, I believe that we should be very cautious when it comes to coming into contact with direct sunlight.
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	O	4120	Everyone is at risk so we should be aware of that./
EBA1415_TRJB_1_SC_ES-05468	R-1-50	4121	Another way you can get skin cancer is your location.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	O	4853	It is known that excess sunlight maybe damaging for one's health, but the most dangerous part is after.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-2-4	4854	Damage to genetic molecules in skin cells from direct sunlight is called sunburn.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	O	4855	When a body suffers from sun poisoning, the body must transport blood to pick up the dead cells, caused by sun poisoning.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-5-6	4856.1	If the sunburn is severe enough, not all dead skin cells will be removed, so the cells cannot create enough melotonin, or protect the body, leading to more chances for sunburns , and most importantly, cancer.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-3-50	4857	Skin cancer is caused by excess exposure to uvb radiation, where it will hit the cells and mutate while multiplying.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-3-4	4858	The uvb radiation rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin, when there is excess uvb rays, real problems could occur.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-2-3	4859	Worse yet, the uvb radiation comes from the sun.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-2-50	4860	Therefore, the more sunlight you absorb, the higher chance you have of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05512	R-1-2	4861.1	The most sunlight occurs from the the Tropic of cancer and the Tropic of capricorn (23 degrees N, 23 degrees S), therefore more rays affect the skin in this region, leading to sunburn, which raises the possibility of having skin cancer.

EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4871	Well, skin is the largest organ, it covers every region of our bodies in order to protect our inner tissue from infection and loss of water.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4872	Also, our skin helps regulate our body temperature./
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4873	There is many skin disorders, dieseases, and conditions but one of the most fear is skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4874	What causes skin cancer?
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-2-50	4875	One of the main reasons we get skin cancer is too much exposure to the sun.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4876	Even though your skin is tough, it can protect you from everything.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4877	One of those thing is uvb radiation.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4878	So, uvb radiation is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-3-4	4879	When human skin is hit w/ normal amounts of uvb radiation, the suns rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4880	Research shows that our bodies are good at repairing this typical amount of damage, but, some problems may occur with excessive exposure to the uvb rays./
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-1-3	4881.1	Depending on where you live, the amount of uvb radiation may avery, and your chances of developing skin cancer may be higher or lower depending on  where you live.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-1-50	4881.2	Depending on where you live, the amount of uvb radiation may avery, and your chances of developing skin cancer may be higher or lower depending on  where you live.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-1-50	4882	This means people closer to the equator have a higher risk of and need to be aware of the dangers of direct sunlight, while those who live in areas w/ less direct sunlight should be concerned, there is also a low risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4883	Some areas with more skin exposure to the sun or areas such as northern third of Australia and the southern part of the United States.
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-2-3	4884	So, what makes sense is that the more direct sunlight there is, the more uvb radiation there is./
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-1-50	4885	Studies show that the less degrees north of the equator you are,  the incidence of skin cancer relativly goes up./
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	O	4886	Have you ever had a really bad sunburn?
EBA1415_KNKC_3_SC_ES-05597	R-5-50	4887	Suffering just one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life.//
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	O	4888	You can develop skin cancer in different ways.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	R-5-50	4889	One way you can develope skin cancer is by getting sunburn.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	R-5-6	4890.1	If you get a severe or even multiple sunburns that can cause the cells in your body not to replace the dead cells and that can lead to skin cancer or even death.

EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	O	4891	Another way to develop skin cancer is by getting diseases and skin disorders.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	O	4892	In the document Background: Skin Damage ot stated that there are three main types of skin cancer a person can develop, they are basel cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	O	4893	These types of skin cancer can have a really big sever damage to your body and also can lead to death.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	R-1-50	4894	Another way that can lead to skin cancer is living in hot areas like by the Equator.
EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	R-1-2	4895.1	Living by the Equator can lead to skin cancer b ecause it allows people to have direct sunlight and that can cause people to develope sunburns or even the skin disorders by killing the healthy cells in your body.

EBA1415_WSAL_1_SC_ES-05354	O	4896	Extreme weathers is another big cause that leads to skin cancer, that's why it's very important to protect your skin and take good care of it.//
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	R-1-50	4897	What leads to differences in the risks of developing skin cancer is that you can get it if you live nea the equator.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	O	4898	People also live not by the equator could get skin cancer also, it depends on where you are living.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	O	4899	People with skin cancer usually get sunburns (sun poisoning).
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	R-4-5	4900	Sun burns are caused by damage skin cells in you body.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	O	4901	Most of the time the skin repairs itself but sometime it doesn't.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	R-6-50	4902	If it doesn't repair itself that means you have skin cnacer.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	O	4903	another one is undetected growth, it can cause it to by being there.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	O	4904	Go check it out by going to a doctor office to see if it is skin cancer or not.
EBA1415_LRJE_7_SC_ES-05136	O	4905	Our skin protects us by blocking off all harmful bacteria and viruses.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_SC_ES-06156	O	4909	Skin cancer is the most feared cause skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells, and everyone is at risk of developing it.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_SC_ES-06156	R-1-2	4910	To thoughs who live close to the equator are in danger because of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_SC_ES-06156	R-2-3	4911	The more direct sunlight there is, the more Uvb radiation there is.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_SC_ES-06156	O	4912	Our skin forms the barrier between what's inside us and what's outside, this barrier is less than a millemeter thick and can release antibacterial substances that assist in the prevention of an infection.
EBA1415_TTCM_910_SC_ES-06156	O	4913	The skin is composed into 3 layers called Epidermis, Dermis, and the innermost layer, subcutaneous fat.

EBA1415_TTCM_910_SC_ES-06156	O	4915	In some cases, your skin does have some defenses against it.//
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	O	4916	There are a couple of reasons for difference in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	O	4917	However, all these factors can stem from one ultimate source, your position on the planet.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	O	4918	As the earth is round, the sunlight from the sun doesn't hit every part of the earth in equal amount.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-1-2	4919	Right at the equator.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-1-2	4920	For example, you are hit fall on by the rays of the sun.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-1-2	4921	But closer to the poles, the sun's rays ar less.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-6-50	4922.1	Skin cancer develops because when your body is hot with a mess of UV radiation from the sun, it doesn't always clear away all the bad or mutated skin cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-3-6	4922.2	Skin cancer develops because when your body is hot with a mess of UV radiation from the sun, it doesn't always clear away all the bad or mutated skin cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-2-3	4922.3	Skin cancer develops because when your body is hot with a mess of UV radiation from the sun, it doesn't always clear away all the bad or mutated skin cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-1-2	4923.1	There fore, the closer you are to the equator the more sun light that will hit you and decrease the amount of time it takes to get a serious sunburn or sun poisoning.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-2-5	4923.2	There fore, the closer you are to the equator the more sun light that will hit you and decrease the amount of time it takes to get a serious sunburn or sun poisoning.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-5-50	4924	The more severe sun burn or sun posisioning, the greater the risk of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	O	4925	Another important factor in the differences in the risk for devloping skin cancer is the frequency which also stems from your position on the planet.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-5-50	4926	Just one serious sunburn in childhood can double the of developing skin cancer in later life.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-1-5	4927.1	This is connected to your position or latitude on the earth as the closer you are to the equator and to the direct sun light, the more often it is that you will get a sun burn from being outside.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-2-5	4927.2	This is connected to your position or latitude on the earth as the closer you are to the equator and to the direct sun light, the more often it is that you will get a sun burn from being outside.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05505	R-5-50	4928.1	Therefore, the most important factors in the difference in risk in developing skin cancer are, latitude from the equator, the amount of tiem spent in the sun, and how many serious sunburns you've received.//

EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-2-50	4930	There are many ways to get skin cancer like staying out in the sun for too long or etc.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-1-50	4931	But if you live closer to the equator you have a higher chance of obtaining skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	O	4932	The article named Latitude and Direct Sunlight stated "people closer to the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	O	4933	Those who live in areas with less direct sunlight may be less concerned about any dangers, although there are still some risks associated with sun exposure wherever you live and at any time of the year."/
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-5-50	4934	Another way a person can get skin cancer is by a sunburn.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-5-6	4935	The article sunburn stated "If a sunburn is severe enough, it becomes less likely that all damaged skin cells will be removed.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-5-50	4936	Suffering just one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-5-50	4937	These changes also double if a person has five or more sunburns at any age."
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	R-5-50	4938	So just 1 serious sun burn may give you sunburn or multiple not serious sunburn can also boost up your probability of obtaining skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	O	4939	So in conclusion there are many possible ways of obtaining skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04888	O	4940	And you should see a doctor if you think you might have skin cancer.//
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-1-50	4941	Many things lead to the differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-1-50	4942	Latitude, or the degrees north/south of the equator, plays a big factor in these risks.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	O	4943	From a study on ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, a point graph was featured, showing the skin cancer incidence per 100,000 in different latitudes.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	O	4944	at 55 degrees north, where the sunlight wasn't as direct year-round, there was approximately 5 skin cancer incidence per 100,000, over double that of 55 degrees!.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-1-50	4945.1	that latitude, or the amount of sunlight, affects skin cancer incidence.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-2-50	4945.2	that latitude, or the amount of sunlight, affects skin cancer incidence.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-3-4	4947	Researchers have discovered that abnormal amounts of uvb radiation, causes damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells from tests on human skin cells & a muse model.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-3-50	4948	Even though skin proves itself to be great at repairing and protecting, too much of this uvb radiation is proven to highten the risk of skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05499	R-11-12	4949	Melanin, a pigment produced in the outer layer of skin, makes it easier for the skin to produce vitamin D.

EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	O	5062	One's skin is one of the most important and biggest organ in his or her body.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-12-3	5063	Skin protects a body by regulating temperature, producing vitamin D, keeping water in body, fighting off bacteria, and protecting one from chemical and solar radiation; however, when one has skin cancer, it prevents the skin from functioning and can be fatal.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-2-50	5064	That is why it is important to prevent skin cancer by acting against the (known) leading cause: the sun./
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-1-50	5065	To start, different people around the world are at a higher risk of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-1-2	5066	This is because at different locations, there is more exposure to the sun.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	O	5067	According to www.ncbi.nlm.nil.gov, one's risks drop from 6 per 100,000 at 30oN to about one per 100,000 at 55oN.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	O	5068	This is because the higher latitude, the farther from the equator where there is the msot direct sunlight./
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-2-50	5069	However, why does the sun cause skin cancer?
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-3-4	5070	The sun rays, UVb radiation, damage skin.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-3-4	5071.1	According to science national geographic, "The rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in skin cells..." Cancer is caused when there is uncontrolled growth of damaged cells; therefore, when the sun damages one's skin, one is at higher risk of cancer./

EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	O	5072	Lastly, body does have a defense against sun damaged cells.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	O	5073	When gets burnt, his or her body sends ecessive amounts of blood to repair the area, leading to one's skin becoming more red then the rest of his or her body.
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-5-6	5074	However, according to www.utsandiego, "If a sunburn is severe enough, it becomes less likely that all damaged cells will be removed..."
EBA1415_SDMK_4_SC_ES-04764	R-3-50	5075	Therefore, the more exposure to direct UVb radiation, them ore of a chance one will develope skin cancer.//

EBA1415_SWAF_1_SC_ES-04836	R-2-50	5344.1	Many speculate that there is more people getting skin cancer close to the equator, and thats because of the Amount of Direct Sunlight these areas get.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_SC_ES-04836	R-1-2	5344.2	Many speculate that there is more people getting skin cancer close to the equator, and thats because of the Amount of Direct Sunlight these areas get.
EBA1415_SWAF_1_SC_ES-04836	R-2-3	5345.1	The more direct sunlight there is, the more uvb radiation there is, wich leads to skin cancer.//
EBA1415_SWAF_1_SC_ES-04836	R-3-50	5345.2	The more direct sunlight there is, the more uvb radiation there is, wich leads to skin cancer.//
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-2-50	5346	The thing that can cause skin cancer is the light from the sun.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-2-5	5347	I believe this happens because their is to much heat burning your skin out.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-4-6	5348.1	And if the damage is done you have to get the burned cells cleared out or it can develope to a case of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-6-50	5348.2	And if the damage is done you have to get the burned cells cleared out or it can develope to a case of skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-5-50	5349	And these burns that can develope into skin cancer can be painful.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-5-50	5350	Also if you have had one or more sunburns your at chance to get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	O	5351	Skin cancer can not be pasted to anotehr person.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-1-50	5352	But every one is at risk of getting skin cancer in their life time.
EBA1415_SVJJ_2_SC_ES-05621	R-1-50	5353	Mostly for these people who live in hot places like the southern parts of the United States.//
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	O	5354	Skin cancer is, by definition, the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	O	5355	The 3 main varieties of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-1-50	5356.1	The 2 factors that increase your chance of aquirring skin cancer are your distance from the equator and the amount of melanin your skin contains./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-11-50	5356.2	The 2 factors that increase your chance of aquirring skin cancer are your distance from the equator and the amount of melanin your skin contains./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-1-50	5357	The first factor of having an increased or decreased chance for succumbing to skin cancer is your distance from the equator.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-1-2	5358	The amount of sun you will receive near the equator will be higher than the amount of sun you will be receiving near the poles.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-2-3	5359	The direct sunlight also causes higher amounts of uvb radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-3-4	5360	When uvb hits the skin, the rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in your skin cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-3-6	5361	However, your body can repair those cells, unless the rays of uvb radiation number too high./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-11-12	5362	Second, Melanin is a special pigment produced in the epidermis.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-11-12	5363.1	This pigment protects us from solar radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-12-3	5363.2	This pigment protects us from solar radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-1-2	5364	The amounts of melanin in the body vary from person to person. You may not need as much melanin if you live in a region where the amount of direct sunlight is low.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	O	5365	The positive of containing less melanin is that your body can produce more vitamin d.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-1-2	5366	The effects would be the opposite if you lived in a region with a lot of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	R-11-12	5367	One would want melanin for protection, and would have to aquirre vitamin d elsewhere./
EBA1415_LZBA_4_SC_ES-05528	O	5368	In conclusion skin cancer is based on different factors, but there will always be a chance of succumbing to this disease.//
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05850	O	5369	There are several skin disorders, conditions, and diseases.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05850	O	5370	Of these, skin cancer is among the most feared because everyone is at some risk of developing skin cancer, but some people are at higher risk than others.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05850	O	5371	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05850	O	5372	There are three main types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWDG_11_SC_ES-05850	O	5373	By all means, early detection of skin cancer gives you the maximum chance for successful treatment.//
EBA1415_TTKP_4-5_SC_ES-06162	R-2-50	5374	What can lead to having skin cancer is the sun.//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5375	Ther are many ways of developing skin cancer throughout your life.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5376	First off skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5377	All kinds of skin cancer can develop depending on the type of skin cell that reproduces irregularly.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5378	Overall there are three main varieties of skin cancer basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5379	basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma makes up 95% of skin cancer, but malignant melanoma only makes up 5%.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5380	However malignant melanoma is the one with the most deaths from skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-1-2	5381	Secondly depending on location, the amount of direct sunlight you will get.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5382	This means you need to be more aware of dangers of direct sunlight.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-1-2	5383	Even if you live in areas with less direct sunlight there are still some risks with sun exposure wherever you live and at any time of the year.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-1-2	5384.1	Most year-round sunlight is between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, since there is more sunlight the higher amount of uvb radiatoin there is.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-2-3	5384.2	Most year-round sunlight is between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, since there is more sunlight the higher amount of uvb radiatoin there is.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5385	Thirdly your skin is the body's largest organ which can cover an area of 21 square feet.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5386	Your skin releases antibacterial substances that assist in the prevention of infection and manufactures vitamin D for converting calcium into health bones.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5387	Skin is made up of three layers, outermost skin is the epidermis, middle is the dermis, and innermost is subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5388	The middle layer includes collagen, elastin, and nerve endings, the inn most layer acts as a energy source, cushion, and insulator for the body.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-12-3	5389.1	Skin can't protect you from everything for example uvb radiation, normal amounts of uvb cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-3-4	5389.2	Skin can't protect you from everything for example uvb radiation, normal amounts of uvb cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	O	5390	Our bodies are good at repairing this damage, however it is a problem when there is extreme exposure to uvb radiation.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-12-3	5391.1	Skin have a couple of difenses against SR, melanin is a special pigment which helps to protect us from SR. Lastly sunburn are caused by damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.

EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-5-6	5392	Sunburns happen when the body directs blood to skin to repair or remove damaged cells which makes are skin red.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-5-6	5393	Sunburned skin cells not removed are cleared away/replaced but not all the time.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-5-6	5394	If you sunburn is severe enough it becomes less likely to be removed.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05173	R-5-50	5395	One serious sunburn during childhood can double chances of skin cancer in life.//
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	O	5396	Skin cancer is the most common form of skin cancer in the United States.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	O	5397	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	O	5398	There are three main varieties of skin  cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell cell carcinoma, and malignant melonoma.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	O	5399	Basal and squamous cell carcinomas make up about 95 percent of skin cancers.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	O	5400	However, malignant melanoma is responsible for the deaths from skin cancer.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-3-50	5401	One cause is too much exposure to uvb radiation which is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-3-4	5402	The rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-5-50	5403	Another cause of skin cancer is sunburns.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-5-6	5404.1	Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-6-50	5404.2	Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-5-50	5405	Suffering just one serious sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_AEKD_5_SC_ES-05584	R-5-50	5406	These chances also double if a person has five or more sunburns at any age.//
EBA1415_HNJD_4_SC_ES-05805	R-5-50	5407	What leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer is sunburn.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_SC_ES-05805	R-5-6	5408.1	The text says "sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer."
EBA1415_HNJD_4_SC_ES-05805	R-6-50	5408.2	The text says "sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer."
EBA1415_HNJD_4_SC_ES-05805	O	5409	To me this is why people should always wear sunburn in the summer because no one wants skin cancer.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_SC_ES-05805	O	5410	The story stated "... skin cancer is among the most feared because everyone is at some risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_HNJD_4_SC_ES-05805	O	5411	There are 3 types of skin cancer basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.

EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04725	R-1-50	5415	Depending on where you live, can put you at a higher risk for skin cancer.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04725	R-1-2	5416.1	For example, if you live closer to the equator you experience more direct sunlight that can cause cancer.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04725	R-2-50	5416.2	For example, if you live closer to the equator you experience more direct sunlight that can cause cancer.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04725	R-1-50	5417	This is shown in graph of how there is more cases of skin cancer closer to the equator.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04725	O	5418	The amount of sunlight you recieve.
EBA1415_RDJKa_5_SC_ES-04725	R-3-4	5419	As states in the text, "The skin hit with normal amounts of Uvb radiation, the rays cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cell."

EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05444	R-2-50	5422	The most effictive cause is the sun.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05444	R-2-4	5423.1	The sun burns your skin and that causes skin cells to die and then your body works hard to produce more which leaves you with a sunburn because of the blood overflow.
EBA1415_TFBM_1_SC_ES-05444	R-4-5	5423.2	The sun burns your skin and that causes skin cells to die and then your body works hard to produce more which leaves you with a sunburn because of the blood overflow.

EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04889	O	5440	There are various ways to develope skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04889	R-2-50	5441	The amount of direct sunlight exposure can result in skin cancer, depending on the amount of time exposed to the sun.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04889	R-1-50	5442	The skin cancer incidence by latitude chart shows that the further away (North) of the equator, the less chances of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04889	R-5-6	5443.1	Severe sunburns can also develope skin cancer is sunburned skin cells aren't removed.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04889	R-6-50	5443.2	Severe sunburns can also develope skin cancer is sunburned skin cells aren't removed.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04889	R-5-6	5444.1	The article from UtSandiego stated that if a Sun-burn is severe enough it is less likely that all damaged cells will be removed, which in fact might develope skin cancer.

EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5450	Before I started to read the text, I tried to think about what skin cancer cells were.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	R-3-50	5451	I thought it was a type of cancer you get wher you get to much radiation from the sun.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5452	But, I found out that skin cancer is a growth of abnormal cells.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5453	How did these cell start to grow though?
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5454	There is three types of skin cancer, I believe.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5455	Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5456	Basal cell carcinoma, leaves nasty, dark spots on your face.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5457	But scientist concidered malignant melanoma to be the deadliest, because it caused the most deaths in the United States by skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5458	Scientist believe that checking your skin, for weird changes couldhelp detect skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	O	5459	And the earlier you detect soemthing, the better you could treat it.
EBA1415_TWPK_3_SC_ES-05056	R-3-50	5460.1	I still believe skin cancer is caused by radiation from the sun, because in the text "your skin protects you", in paragraph 3, it says that many harmful effect on animal or human skin, comes from to much Uvb radiation.

EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	O	5985	Most fear skin cancer because it's the most common cancer in the United States.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	O	5986	Skin cancer is basically when you obtain uncontrolled amounts of skin cells.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	O	5987	The type of cancer depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	O	5988	Three main skin cancers are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which make up approximately 95% of skin cancers, and malignant melanoma, which only occur in 5% of skin cancers, but are responsible for the most deaths from skin cancer.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	O	5989	Early detection of skin cancer gives you the maximum chance for successful treatment./
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	R-2-50	5990	A common way to get skin cancer is too much exposure to the sun.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	R-1-2	5991	For example, if you live near the equator, the more consistent direct sunlight will be.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	O	5992	Other places include the Northern third of Australia and the Southern parts of the United States.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	R-3-50	5993	Another risk is uvb radiation, which is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_RHSG_3_SC_ES-05093	R-5-50	5994	Finally, the last common type of risk is sunburn.//
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	O	5995	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.

EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	R-4-5	5997	Sunburns hurt the genetic molecules in the skin cells which can lead to burns on the skin with painful feelings.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	R-5-50	5998	Although minor sunburns are not the cause of skin cancer, severe sunburns are.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	R-6-50	5999	If the damaged cells are not removed skin cancer will take its place.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	R-2-3	6000	UVb radiation which is a type of solar radiation is from the sun.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	R-3-50	6001	This radiation can also lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04992	R-1-2	6002	How ever UVb radiation is at a higher rate where there is more direct sunlight which is common between the tropics of Caner and of Capricorn.

EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-06257	R-6-50	6016.2	Sun burned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-06257	R-4-5	6017	More damage to genetic molecules lead to a bad sunburn.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-06257	O	6018	Skin cancer is most feared because anyone is at risk of developing it.
EBA1415_ERAP_7_SC_ES-06257	O	6019	Some people have a higher risk of getting skin cancer than others.//
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	O	6020	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of skin cells and it is the most common form of cancer because everyone is at a risk of getting it.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	O	6021	There are three types of skin cancer, but the most deadly is malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	O	6022	The type of skin cancer depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-5-50	6023.1	While many things contribute to someone developing skin cancer, you are more susceptible to getting it if you spend a lot of time in direct sunlight, and have many cases of sunburn./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-2-50	6023.2	While many things contribute to someone developing skin cancer, you are more susceptible to getting it if you spend a lot of time in direct sunlight, and have many cases of sunburn./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-2-50	6024	One of the reasons that leads to the risk of developing skin cancer is spending time in direct sunlight.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-1-3	6025	Depending on where you live, you can be exposed to higher levels of UVb radiation.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-1-2	6026	The closer you live to the equator, the more direct sunlight there is. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-2-3	6027	Since there is more sunlight, then that means more UVb radiation. 
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-3-4	6028	According to researchers, when the skin is hit with UVb radiation it results in damage to genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-1-4	6029	This shows that the more time that you spend in direct sunlight causes you to damage your skin cells./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-5-50	6030	Another cause that leads to the development of skin cancer are sunburns.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-4-5	6031	Sunburns occur when there is damage to genetic molecules in DNA.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-5-6	6032.1	Skin cells that are sunburned and not removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-6-50	6032.2	Skin cells that are sunburned and not removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-5-50	6033	If you have a sunburn during childhood, the more likely you are to develop skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-5-50	6034	Also if you have five or more sunburns at any age there is double the chance you get skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-5-50	6035.1	As you can see, while many things contribute to someone developing skin cancer, you are more likely to develop it if you spend time in direct sunlight and have many cases of sunburn.//
EBA1415_SWCT_6_SC-04875	R-2-50	6035.2	As you can see, while many things contribute to someone developing skin cancer, you are more likely to develop it if you spend time in direct sunlight and have many cases of sunburn.//
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-1-50	6036	Developing skin cancer can be harder when you are not close to the equator.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-1-2	6037.1	Being at the equator (or close to it) gives more risk of skin cancer, becasue there is more UVb rays from the sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-3-50	6037.2	Being at the equator (or close to it) gives more risk of skin cancer, becasue there is more UVb rays from the sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-2-3	6037.3	Being at the equator (or close to it) gives more risk of skin cancer, becasue there is more UVb rays from the sun.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-2-50	6038	The sun is major issue to skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-5-50	6039	Sun burns can lead to skin cancer, the more sunburns you've had the more likely it will be to get skin cancer.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-5-6	6040	When sunburns happen cells die once the cells are dead they are replaced.
EBA1415_TFHC_4_SC_ES-05828	R-6-50	6041	But sometimes cells are not replaced and then causing skin cancer.//
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-1-50	6042	One thing that leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer is where you live on the geographic climate map.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-1-50	6043	On the graph "Skin cancer Incidence by latitude" more cases happened with latitude 30-45 degrees North of the equator, while Latitudes from 60 degrees north had none.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-1-50	6044	This shows how depending on the latitude of where you live can lead to Skin Cancer because those who live closer to the equator ranging from the "Tropic of Cancer" to the "Tropic of Capricorn" have a higher risk of getting skin cancer than those further away.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-5-50	6045	Another factor that leads the risk of getting skin cancer is sunburn.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-5-6	6046.1	The article "Sunburn" states on the third paragraph second to last sentence that "Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-6-50	6046.2	The article "Sunburn" states on the third paragraph second to last sentence that "Sunburned skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	O	6047	Normally, absorbed or damaged skin cells are cleaned away and replaced with new cells, but this doesn't always happen."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-5-50	6048	This shows how getting a sunburn is what leads to skin cancer because even though your body is suppose to clear the damaged skin cells and replace them with new ones.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	O	6049	That doesn't always happen.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-5-50	6050	Sunburn also can lead to skin cancer because those who get sunburn often are in risk of getting skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-5-50	6051	In the article Sunburn it says "Chances also double if a person has five or more sunburns at any age."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5408_9	R-5-50	6052	This shows how sunburn is a factor why people get skin cancer because the more you get sunburned, the higher the risk of getting skin cancer.//
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	O	6053	There are many things that risk you to develop skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-1-2	6054	Being close to the tropics of cancer and capricorn, and equator exposed to the sun a lot.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-1-50	6055.1	First of all, the closer you are to the tropics of cancer or capricorn, and the equator, the more risk you are at for skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-2-50	6055.2	First of all, the closer you are to the tropics of cancer or capricorn, and the equator, the more risk you are at for skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-2-50	6056.1	This is because these latitudes get direct sunlight.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-1-2	6056.2	This is because these latitudes get direct sunlight.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-1-2	6057.1	Some areas by them are exposed to direct sunlight in these areas, the amount of uvb radiation is high.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-1-3	6057.2	Some areas by them are exposed to direct sunlight in these areas, the amount of uvb radiation is high.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-2-3	6058	The more direct sunlight, the more uvb radiation there is, and that is harmful to the skin.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	O	6059	Secondly, skin protects one's body.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-3-4	6060	Researchers have found that when the skin is hit with normal amounts of uvb radiation, rays cause small damages to genetic molecules in the skin.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	O	6061	Bodies are good at radiations.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-11-12	6062	Having less Melanin makes it easier for the body to make vitamin D.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-11-12	6063.1	The downside is that it decreases the chances of uvb protection.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-12-3	6063.2	The downside is that it decreases the chances of uvb protection.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-1-50	6064	In conclusion, the closer you are to the equator, the more risk you have of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLHT_5_SC_ES-05204	R-2-3	6065	Especially with the sun giving out uvb radiation.//
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6066	Many things lead to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-1-50	6067	Three reasons there are differences in the risk of developing skin cancer are type of cancer cell, where you live and what ethnicity you are.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6068	These 3 reasons why there are differences leading to the risk of skin cancer./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6069	First, the type of cancer cell can make a difference in the risk.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6070	Some people might have cells in their body that can cause cancer.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6071	There are 3 types of skin cancer cells, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6072	As it states in the article, "Background: Skin Cancer," "together, basal and squamous cell carcinoma make up approximately 95 percent of skin cancer."
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6073	If you check your skin you can prevent skin cancer./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-1-50	6074	Another way that leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer is where you live.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-1-50	6075	Where you live is a big part in the difference of risk leading to skin cancer because as it says in the article "Latitude and direct sunlight," it states that, "people closer to the the equator need to be more aware of the dangers of direct sunlight."
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-1-2	6076.1	People might get skin cancer more often and it is more common to get it in a place like the carribean or Florida then a place like canada because the sun isn't as strong in canada like it is in the caribean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-2-50	6076.2	People might get skin cancer more often and it is more common to get it in a place like the carribean or Florida then a place like canada because the sun isn't as strong in canada like it is in the caribean.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-2-50	6077	This is why there could be a difference in the risk of developing skin cancer./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6078	Lastly, the third reason why there are differeces leading to the risk of skin cancer is because of your ethnicity.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6079	In the article "Sunburn" it does no go at and directly say this but from prior knowledge I know this.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6080	If you are hispanic or African american or Indian you might not burn as much because your culture is used to it so you will be a little darker skinned and probably tan not burn some from Germany or Poland or Ireland are going to burn easiler beacause they and their budies aren't used to those weather conditions.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-5-50	6081	When you get burnt you have a bad chance you could get skin cancer when you are older so you need to be careful.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-5-50	6082	This is the third reason and difference that leads to the risk of developing skin cancer./
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	R-1-50	6083	Overall, three main reasons that lead to difference in the risk of developing skin cancer are the type of cancer cells, where you live and your ethnicity.
EBA1415_BLRW_3_SC_ES-05178	O	6084	These thing really determine what can cause skin cancer.//

EBA1415_TRKM_1_SC-06044	O	6092	There are risk in certain skin cancer that can cause death in high or low risk. //
EBA1415_RDCS_2_SC_ES-04708	O	6093	There is different skinds of skin cancer, and they are all caused in different ways.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_SC_ES-04708	O	6094	The most common type of skin cancer is basal cell carcinomas.
EBA1415_RDCS_2_SC_ES-04708	O	6095	The basal cell carcinoma is a dark patch that looks like a bump./
EBA1415_RDCS_2_SC_ES-04708	R-5-50	6096	Sun burn is a good way to get skin cancer.

EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	O	6380	There are different varieties of skin cancers it just depends on the type of skin cells that reproduces.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	O	6381	There are 3 types of skin cancers.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	O	6382	The names of them are Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	O	6383	These names all came from the skin cells that reproduce abnormally.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	O	6384	Although majority people in the U.S. get skin cancer, malignant melanoma is what actually causes the death for the type of skin cancer.'
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	R-5-50	6385	Sunburns can also cause skin cancer if you get them numerous times and they are high at risk.
EBA1415_RCGJa_4_SC_ES-04682	O	6386	These are some things that lead to differences in developing skin cancer.//
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	R-5-50	6387	There are several reasons that lead to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	O	6388	In the article "Background: Skin Cancer" it says "...skin cancer is among the most feared because everyone is at some risk of developing skin cancer, but some people are at a higher risk than others."
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	O	6389	This is one difference.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	O	6390	In this article it also says "skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells."
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	R-3-50	6391	Another risk of developing skin cancer is UVb radiation .
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	R-3-4	6392	UVb radiation are "rays that cause small amounts of damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells."
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	O	6393	Even though our bodies are good at repairing these types of things, "problems arise when there is excessive exposure to UVb radiation."/
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	R-5-50	6394	The last difference is sunburn.
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	R-4-5	6395	"Sunburn is caused by damage to genetic molecules in skin cells."
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	R-6-50	6396	When and if those skin cells aren't repaired, that can result in skin cancer./
EBA1415_SWSP_1_SC_ES-04855	O	6397	These are the differences that lead to developing cancer.//
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	O	6398	Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	O	6399	So what causes the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells?
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-5-6	6400	If you get sun poisoning, or sunburn, new skin grows back after.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-6-50	6401	But if not all of the sun posioning is removed, it can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-3-5	6402.1	You can get sunburn by UV radiation. And if you live on or close to the equator, you have more of a chance of getting sun poisoning which in extreme cases, can lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-1-5	6402.2	You can get sunburn by UV radiation. And if you live on or close to the equator, you have more of a chance of getting sun poisoning which in extreme cases, can lead to skin cancer.

EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	O	6403	You can avoid this naturally because your skin protets you.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-12-3	6404	Its a waterproof insolating sheild, that protects the body from extreme temperatures, damgaging solar radiation, and chemicals.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	O	6405	UV radiation is a type of solar radiation.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-3-4	6406	Researchers have found that when the skin is hit with a normal amount of UV radiation, the rays cause small damage to genetic molecules in the skin cells.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	O	6407	But if the skin is hit with an abromaly large amount of UV radiation, problems come up.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-12-3	6408	To prevent that, skin has defenses against solar radiation.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	R-11-3	6409	The epidermis produces melanin which helps us when we are under solar radiation.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05335	O	6410	So in conclusion, skin cancer is very common and can be dangarase but we can avoid it.//
EBA1415_TWNB_3_SC_ES-04988	O	6411	You can get skin cancer from exposure to UVb radiation.

EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-2-50	6415	Time is one of the first risks of skin cancer developing.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	O	6416	For example, if you go out in the middle of the afternoon, when the sun is highest in the sky.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-2-4	6417	Then there is on bigger risk of the sun, or direct sunlight, affecting your skin cells or, not alot of direct sunlight but some may hit your cells in the morning, but still affect you, just not as drastically./
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-1-50	6418	Placement is another factor.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-1-50	6419	The closer you are to the equator, or ceneter of the earth, then the more at risk you are for skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-1-2	6420.1	The amount of direct sunlight is different at different places on earth, so the risk will be greater closer to the equator than far away.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-1-50	6420.2	The amount of direct sunlight is different at different places on earth, so the risk will be greater closer to the equator than far away.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-2-3	6421.1	Also, depending on how much direct sunlight reaches you it also affects the amount of UVb radiation, which causes abnormal growth in cells, on skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-3-50	6421.2	Also, depending on how much direct sunlight reaches you it also affects the amount of UVb radiation, which causes abnormal growth in cells, on skin cancer.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-12-50	6422	Protectants, or parts of your skin that can help to protect your cells from harm, is the last factor to skin cancer that will be discussed.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	O	6423	Since the skin is made of 3-layers, epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat, each layer has protectants to help the cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-11-12	6424.1	The epidermis, for example, produces a special pigment called melanin to protect the cells from solar radiation, like Uvb radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	R-12-3	6424.2	The epidermis, for example, produces a special pigment called melanin to protect the cells from solar radiation, like Uvb radiation.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	O	6425	The tissue and elastin in the dermis and the tissue in the subcutaneous fat are also helpful in protecting the cells.
EBA1415_LZBA_3_SC_ES-05498	O	6426	These 3 factors lead to differences in the way skin cancer develops.//
EBA1415_SEAL_7_SC_ES-04808	R-3-50	6427	Skin cancer can be caused by many reasons.
EBA1415_SEAL_7_SC_ES-04808	R-3-50	6428	Some of the main reasons why its caused is basically, irregularly production of skin cells, and because of long exposure of uvb sun rays.
EBA1415_SEAL_7_SC_ES-04808	R-3-50	6429	The uvb sunrays increase your chance of developing skin cacner later on.
EBA1415_SEAL_7_SC_ES-04808	R-5-50	6430	In fact, if you got severely sunburned, it doubles your risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_SEAL_7_SC_ES-04808	O	6431	Skin cancer can be avoided, but everyone is at the risk of developing it.
EBA1415_SEAL_7_SC_ES-04808	R-2-50	6432	The differences in the risk of developing skin cancer are that if you put on sunscreen lotion on with medium to high uv ray protection, and clean your body's skin, you will msot likely or maybe not even develope skin cancer, but if you don't apply sunscreen lotion when you go outside for long periods of time and don't take cover from the shade, then you will most likely or have a higher chance of developing skin cancer.//
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05336	O	6433	Skin cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_WSKT_6_SC_ES-05336	O	6434	Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and is feared because everyone is at risk for it.

EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-06176	O	8115	Damaged skin caan be very critical.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-06176	O	8116	While our skin is very tough, it can't really protect us from everything.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-06176	O	8117	Skin releases antibacterial substances that assist in the prevention of infection that will most likely turn into skin cancer.
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-06176	O	8118	The passage says that "checking your skin for suspicious changes can help with detecting skin cancer at its earliest stages."
EBA1415_TTFW_1_SC_ES-06176	O	8119	From that information it tells me that skin cancer is more than one stage.

EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	O	8127	One of those differences is where you are at in the world.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-1-2	8128	For example if you live close to the equator then you will have more exposure to sunlight.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-2-4	8129.1	The more you are exposed to more aware you have to be because too much exposure to sunlight can cause sunburn which is caused by genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-4-5	8129.2	The more you are exposed to more aware you have to be because too much exposure to sunlight can cause sunburn which is caused by genetic molecules in skin cells.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-5-6	8130	Sunburn happens when the body directs blood to skin to try to repair or remove damaged cells.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-5-6	8131.1	If sunburned skin cells arn't removed then that can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-6-50	8131.2	If sunburned skin cells arn't removed then that can result in skin cancer.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-5-50	8132	By suffering just one severe sunburn in childhood or adolescence it automatically doubles your chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
EBA1415_WSKT_1_SC_ES-05316	R-3-50	8133	Exposure to UVb radiation also leads to skin cancer.

EBA1415_TTFW_2_SC_ES-04909	O	8148	The differences in the leading risk of developing skin cancer is that skin cancer is the most common form in the United States because skin caner is the most uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_SC_ES-04909	O	8149	But there is a possibility that if you have early detections of skin cancer gives you the maximum chance for successful treatment.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_SC_ES-04909	O	8150	But while your skin is tough, it can't completley protect you from everything.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_SC_ES-04909	O	8151	In other words you should go get checked and see if you are ok and see if you don't have no type of skin cancer early so it can be cured and you can have a successful treatment.
EBA1415_TTFW_2_SC_ES-04909	R-5-6	8152.1	But one way if you don't want skin cancer you should stay out of the sun and risk of getting a sunburn because sunburn skin cells that aren't removed can result in skin cancer so in one way you wouldn't want more of this to happen so you should get treated early for better results.//

EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05930	R-2-50	8407	The sun is one of the reasons to what leads to differences in the risk of developing skin cancer.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05930	O	8408	It can cause major changes to your skin and also to your blood cells that lead to skin cancer.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05930	R-5-50	8409	Or sunburns for instance, the worse it is, the easier it is to get skin cancer.
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05930	O	8410	Or if you have something strange on your skin and the longer you wait to tell a doctor about it or get checked up, the worse it can get and the harder it will be to get rid of it./
EBA1415_SERS_1314_SC_ES-05930	R-1-2	8411.1	It also depends on where you live because wherever the sun hits the most, the more likely it is for the person to get skin cancer.

EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8454	Did you know there are numerous skin disorders, conditions, and diseases.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8455	As the text state "Skin cancer is among the most feared."
EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8456	The reason I pointed this out was because as I was reading the text, I had learn why it was the most feared.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8457	Let me tell how it is the most feared, everyone is at a risk of developing skin cancer but some are at a higher risk than others.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8458	Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma are the three main varieities of skin cancer.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8459	Another thing I would like to state is that because malignant melanoma only occurs approximately 5 percent of skin cancer cases.
EBA1415_TRWH_1_SC_ES-05534	O	8460	It is still responsible for most deaths from skin cancer.//
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04896	R-5-50	8461	Many things can cause skin cancer.
EBA1415_SWCT_7_SC_ES-04896	R-5-50	8462	Some things are even deadly like Sunburns, and Melanoma.

EBA1415_LRBL_4_SC_ES-05162	O	8471	However malignant melanoma has killed more people and caused so many more deaths.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_SC_ES-05162	O	8472	Your skin on your body protects you and if you were to possibly take it off & lay it flat it would cover an area up to 21 square feet.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_SC_ES-05162	O	8473	Our skin is mainly so protective because it has 3 layers.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_SC_ES-05162	O	8474	The epidermis, dermis, & nerve endings (which makes the skin stretchy) Although it protects a lot of things the skin amy still be effected in ways sunburn for example is one of the worst damages to the skin.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_SC_ES-05162	O	8475	Usually the sunburn kills a layer of cells or so to call skin.
EBA1415_LRBL_4_SC_ES-05162	O	8476	But also restores it.

EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8508	What is skin cancer?
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8509	"Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8510	The variety of skin cancer that develops depends on the type of skin cell that reproduces irregularly."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8511	(Background: Skin Damage) What are the various skin cells of skin cancer are mentioned as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, & malignant melanoma.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8512	Of these in the article it states 95% are basal & squamous.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8513	However, malignat is resonsible for the msot deaths even if it only comes 5%.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8514	These types of skin cells can be inferred as how intense the skin cancer is.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8515	Surprisely, the various skin cells are not the only problems of skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-1-50	8516	A difference with inheriatance is the amount of sunlight you recieve in a day/year.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-1-3	8517.1	According to the Latitude of Direct Sunlight, the closer you are to the Equator, the most year-round direct sunlight occurrs between the Tropics of Cancer (23oN) & Capricorn (23oS).
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-1-2	8517.2	According to the Latitude of Direct Sunlight, the closer you are to the Equator, the most year-round direct sunlight occurrs between the Tropics of Cancer (23oN) & Capricorn (23oS).
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-2-3	8517.3	According to the Latitude of Direct Sunlight, the closer you are to the Equator, the most year-round direct sunlight occurrs between the Tropics of Cancer (23oN) & Capricorn (23oS).
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-2-3	8518.1	This leads to having too much UVB radiation that can provoke skin cancer because the more sunlight in the areas the more radaition because radiation is high in this area.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-3-50	8518.2	This leads to having too much UVB radiation that can provoke skin cancer because the more sunlight in the areas the more radaition because radiation is high in this area.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-1-2	8518.3	This leads to having too much UVB radiation that can provoke skin cancer because the more sunlight in the areas the more radaition because radiation is high in this area.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-1-3	8518.4	This leads to having too much UVB radiation that can provoke skin cancer because the more sunlight in the areas the more radaition because radiation is high in this area.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8519	Thankfully, our skins job is protect us.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8520	That's why we have three layers of skin called the epidermis, the dermis, & the subcutaneous fat.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8521	In the articles it states, "While skin is tough, it can't protect you from everything."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-3-4	8522	They gathered a test of normal radiation on a person & found that radiation causes some damage on the skin.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8523	Good thing our bodies are great at reproducing & repairing skin cells fast.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8524	However, in the article it mentions how "the problems arise with excessive radiation."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8525	Another thing that could cause skin cancer is the advantage of having a lot of melanin or too little.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-11-12	8526	In the text, "The advantage of having less melanin is that it is easier for the body to make vitian D.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-11-12	8527.1	The downside is that it decreases our chance of protection from UVB radiation."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-12-3	8527.2	The downside is that it decreases our chance of protection from UVB radiation."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-3-50	8527.3	The downside is that it decreases our chance of protection from UVB radiation."
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-3-50	8528	So depending on this you could possibly yet skin cancer.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	O	8529	I suppose a way to to know is see a doctor & avoid too much sunlight.
EBA1415_KNKC_1_SC_ES-5419_9	R-6-50	8530.1	Finally, another way you can get skin cancer is if sunburned skin cells that aren't removed.
